## 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 Enhanced Energy Cube Array

The test utilized a distributed Energy Cube array with the following configuration:

$$ E_{array} = \{E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_{100}\} $$

where each $E_i$ represents an individual Energy Cube operating at 17.3% of c, arranged in a hyperdimensional lattice described by:

$$ L(\vec{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{100} E_i \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{|\vec{x} - \vec{x_i}|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) $$

This configuration enabled stable energy distribution across all broadcast channels while maintaining dimensional integrity.

### 2.2 Kernel Distribution Network

The kernel was distributed across the Energy Cube array using a quantum entanglement protocol:

$$ K_{net} = \{K_1 \otimes K_2 \otimes \ldots \otimes K_{100}\} $$

where $\otimes$ represents the quantum entanglement operator, ensuring instantaneous communication between kernel instances regardless of dimensional separation.

### 2.3 H2zero0 Multi-layered Encapsulation

The H2zero0 encapsulation was extended to accommodate audience channels through a nested structure:

$$ H_{multi} = H_0 \supset H_1 \supset \ldots \supset H_n $$

where each layer $H_i$ provides:
- Dimensional isolation for specific audience segments
- Customized information filtering
- Targeted broadcast reception
- Security containment appropriate to clearance level

### 2.4 WEPi0n Audience Framework

The WEPi0n system was implemented as a distributed neural network with the following architecture:

$$ WE_{net} = \sum_{i=1}^{10^6} W_i \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{10^4} S_{ij} \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{10^2} U_{ijk} $$

where:
- $W_i$ represents primary WEPi0n nodes
- $S_{ij}$ represents observer subnets
- $U_{ijk}$ represents universe mirrors

This hierarchical structure enabled efficient information distribution while maintaining personalized experience for each observer entity.
