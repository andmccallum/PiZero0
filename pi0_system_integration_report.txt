Operators Implemented:

Operator: Ultracosmic Gravitational Oscillator
Formula: U(G) = A * sin(2πt/T + φ) where A and T vary with cosmic scale effects
Description: Models ultracosmic gravitational forces that cause periodic oscillations and phase changes in system balance

Operator: Market Gravity Integrator
Formula: M(t) = Base * (1 + α * U(G)) where α is the sensitivity factor
Description: Integrates gravitational oscillations into market fluctuations to rebalance systemic instability

Operator: Dynamic Equilibrium Controller
Formula: E(t) = E(t-1) + F_net * Δt, with adjustments from gravitational and market forces
Description: Controls the feedback loop that unbalances and rebalances the system dynamically

Mathematical Details:
1. Ultracosmic Gravitational Oscillator: U(G) = A * sin(2πt/T + φ), where A = 0.2, T = 90, φ = 4.79
2. Market Gravity Integrator: M(t) = Base * (1 + α * U(G)), α = 0.05
3. Dynamic Equilibrium Controller: E(t) = E(t-1) + F_net * Δt, with damping factor 0.01
