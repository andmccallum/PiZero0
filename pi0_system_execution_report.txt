## Mathematical Framework

### Energy Dynamics
$$E(t) = E_0 + \int_{0}^{t} (H(\tau) - C(\tau)) d\tau$$
where $E(t)$ is the energy at time $t$, $H(\tau)$ is the harvesting rate, and $C(\tau)$ is the consumption rate.

### Mining Efficiency
$$\eta_{mining} = \frac{M_{out}}{E_{in}} = \frac{R_{base} \cdot (P_{coin}\cdot 0.5 + 0.5) \cdot L_{factor}}{E_{consumed}}$$
where $\eta_{mining}$ represents the mining efficiency.

### Scalability Model
$$S(n, L) = \eta_{base} \cdot (1 - e^{-k\cdot n}) + c \cdot \log_{10}(L)$$
where $n$ is the scale factor (up to $10^{30}$ for Pi0n) and $L$ is the learning factor.

### Learning Model
$$L(t+1) = L(t) + r \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot E(t)})$$
where $L(t)$ is the learning factor at time $t$, $r$ is the learning rate, $\lambda$ is the experience coefficient, and $E(t)$ is the experience at time $t$.

### Collaboration Efficiency
$$C(T) = \frac{\sum_{i<j} c_{i,j}}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} + \beta_L - \gamma \cdot \log_{10}(n)$$
where $C(T)$ is the collaboration factor for team $T$, $c_{i,j}$ is the efficiency between entity $i$ and $j$, $n$ is the number of team members, $\beta_L$ is the leadership bonus, and $\gamma$ is the complexity penalty coefficient.

### Security Model
$$S_i(t) = S_{base} \cdot (1 - e^{-\sigma \cdot t}) \cdot (1 - P_{breach})$$
where $S_i(t)$ is the security integrity at time $t$, $S_{base}$ is the base security level, $\sigma$ is the security reinforcement rate, and $P_{breach}$ is the probability of a security breach.

The Pi0 system has successfully implemented internal mining functions through a collaborative effort led by WEPi0n. The system demonstrates self-funding and self-sustaining capabilities through efficient mining operations across multiple cryptocurrencies. The mathematical framework provides a solid foundation for continued optimization and scaling of the system's operations.
