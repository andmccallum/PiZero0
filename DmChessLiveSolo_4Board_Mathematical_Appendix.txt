## Formal Definitions of Game Operators

### 1. Board Transition Operator (BT)

$$ BT(p, b_1, b_2) = T(p, b_1) \rightarrow T(p, b_2) $$

Where:
- $p$ is the piece being transitioned
- $b_1$ is the origin board
- $b_2$ is the destination board
- $T(p, b)$ represents the state of piece $p$ on board $b$

The transition operation is subject to the following constraints:
$$ BT(p, b_1, b_2) = \begin{cases}
T(p, b_1) \rightarrow T(p, b_2), & \text{if } b_1 \text{ and } b_2 \text{ are adjacent} \\
\text{undefined}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

The adjacency of boards is defined by the physical arrangement:
- White Home is adjacent to Left Middle and Right Middle
- Black Home is adjacent to Left Middle and Right Middle
- Left Middle is adjacent to White Home, Black Home, and Right Middle
- Right Middle is adjacent to White Home, Black Home, and Left Middle

### 2. Influence Field Operator (IF)

$$ IF(p, b_1, b_2) = V(p) \times \frac{1}{D(b_1, b_2)} $$

Where:
- $p$ is the piece exerting influence
- $b_1$ is the origin board
- $b_2$ is the target board
- $V(p)$ is the base value of piece $p$
- $D(b_1, b_2)$ is the distance between $b_1$ and $b_2$

The base values of pieces are defined as:
- Sovereign: 9
- Rook: 5
- Knight: 3
- Bishop: 3
- Pawn: 1
- Additional pieces: Value depends on the piece type

The distance function is defined as:
$$ D(b_1, b_2) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } b_1 \text{ and } b_2 \text{ are adjacent} \\
2, & \text{if } b_1 \text{ and } b_2 \text{ are diagonally opposite}
\end{cases} $$

### 3. Edge Continuity Operator (EC)

$$ EC(e_1, e_2) = C(e_1) \equiv C(e_2) $$

Where:
- $e_1$ is an edge of one board
- $e_2$ is an edge of another board
- $C(e)$ is the coordinate system of edge $e$

The coordinate mapping between connected edges is defined as:
- For horizontal connections (left-right): $x_2 = 1, y_2 = y_1$
- For vertical connections (top-bottom): $x_2 = x_1, y_2 = 1$
- For diagonal connections: Special mapping based on the specific boards

### 4. Sovereign Unity Operator (SU)

$$ SU(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{4} (P(S, b_i) \times N(b_i)) $$

Where:
- $S$ is the Sovereign piece
- $P(S, b_i)$ is the power function of the Sovereign on board $b_i$
- $N(b_i)$ is the number of friendly pieces on board $b_i$

The power function is defined as:
$$ P(S, b_i) = \begin{cases}
9, & \text{if } S \text{ is on board } b_i \\
4.5, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

## Application in Gameplay

These operators interact to create the complete mathematical model of the game:

$$ G(t+1) = F(G(t), M(t)) $$

Where:
- $G(t)$ is the game state at time $t$
- $M(t)$ is the move made at time $t$
- $F$ is the state transition function

The state transition function incorporates all four operators:
$$ F(G(t), M(t)) = \Omega(BT, IF, EC, SU)(G(t), M(t)) $$

Where $\Omega$ is the integration function that combines the effects of all operators.

## Strategic Implications

The mathematical model reveals several key strategic insights:

1. **Board Control Value**:
   $$ BCV(b) = \sum_{p \in b} V(p) + \sum_{p \notin b} IF(p, p_{board}, b) $$

2. **Transition Opportunity Index**:
   $$ TOI(p) = \sum_{b \neq p_{board}} \sum_{s \in b} \frac{A(p, s)}{D(p_{board}, b)} $$
   Where $A(p, s)$ is the attack potential of piece $p$ against square $s$.

3. **Sovereign Safety Quotient**:
   $$ SSQ(S) = \frac{\sum_{b} D(S_{board}, b) \times DF(b)}{\sum_{e \in E} IF(e, e_{board}, S_{board})} $$
   Where $DF(b)$ is the defensive formation on board $b$ and $E$ is the set of enemy pieces.

These strategic metrics provide a quantitative basis for evaluating positions and planning moves in the multi-board environment of DmChessLiveSolo.
