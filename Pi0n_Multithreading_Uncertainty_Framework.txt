# Pi0n Multithreading with Uncertainty and Fractal Harmonic Decay
## Mathematical Framework and Simulation Results


## 1. Mathematical Framework

The Pi0n system integrates multithreading with quantum-inspired uncertainty principles and fractal harmonic decay. The key equations governing this system are:


### Uncertainty Principle
$$ΔE Δt = \frac{ħ}{2}$$


### Fractal Decay
$$ψ{\left(t \right)} e^{- t α} e^{i t ω}$$


### Energy Conservation
$$E_{total} = E_{information} + E_{thread}$$


### Information Flow
$$I_{flow} = I_{0} \cdot \left(1 - e^{- ΔE γ}\right) e^{- t β}$$


### Thread Efficiency
$$η_{thread} = \frac{Work_{done}}{E_{consumed} + I_{overhead}}$$


### Stability Metric
$$S = S_{0} \left(- \frac{ΔE Δt}{κ} + 1\right)$$


### Security Function
$$Sec = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} \log{\left(p_{i} \right)}$$


### Pi0N Integration
$$Pi0n = Energy_{state} Information_{state} Thread_{state} ∫$$


### Unified Equation
$$Ψ_{Pi0} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ψ_{i} e^{i φ_{i}}$$


### Thread Energy Evolution
The energy of each thread evolves according to the fractal harmonic decay function:
$$E(t) = E_0 e^{-\alpha t} \left( \cos(\omega t + \phi) + 0.2 \sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{\sin(k \omega t)}{k} \right)$$


### Information-Energy Exchange
The exchange between energy and information follows the conservation principle:
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = -\beta E + \gamma I + \eta(t)$$
$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \delta E - \epsilon I - \eta(t)$$
where $\eta(t)$ represents the uncertainty term that preserves the total quantity.
