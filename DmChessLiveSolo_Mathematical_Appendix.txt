## Formal Definitions of Game Operators

### 1. Dimensional Transfer Operator (DT)

$$ DT(p, d_1, d_2) = T(p, d_1) \rightarrow T(p, d_2) $$

Where:
- $p$ is the piece being transferred
- $d_1$ is the origin dimension
- $d_2$ is the destination dimension
- $T(p, d)$ represents the state of piece $p$ in dimension $d$

The transfer operation is subject to the following constraints:
$$ DT(p, d_1, d_2) = \begin{cases}
T(p, d_1) \rightarrow T(p, d_2), & \text{if } (x,y) \in P_{d_1,d_2} \\
\text{undefined}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where $P_{d_1,d_2}$ is the set of portal coordinates connecting dimensions $d_1$ and $d_2$.

### 2. Dimensional Influence Operator (DI)

$$ DI(p, d) = \sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i \times I(p, d_i) $$

Where:
- $p$ is the piece exerting influence
- $d$ is the target dimension
- $w_i$ is the weight factor for dimension $i$
- $I(p, d_i)$ is the influence function of piece $p$ in dimension $d_i$

The influence function is defined as:
$$ I(p, d_i) = \frac{V(p)}{1 + \delta(p, d, d_i)} $$

Where:
- $V(p)$ is the base value of piece $p$
- $\delta(p, d, d_i)$ is the dimensional distance between dimensions $d$ and $d_i$ for piece $p$

### 3. Sovereign Unity Operator (SU)

$$ SU(S) = \prod_{i=1}^{4} (1 + P(S, d_i)) $$

Where:
- $S$ is the Sovereign piece
- $P(S, d_i)$ is the power function of the Sovereign in dimension $d_i$

The power function is defined as:
$$ P(S, d_i) = \alpha_i \times C(S, d_i) $$

Where:
- $\alpha_i$ is the dimensional coefficient for dimension $i$
- $C(S, d_i)$ is the control value of the Sovereign in dimension $d_i$

### 4. Dimensional Resonance Operator (DR)

$$ DR(d_1, d_2) = \alpha \times |\Phi(d_1) - \Phi(d_2)| $$

Where:
- $d_1, d_2$ are the dimensions being compared
- $\alpha$ is the resonance coefficient
- $\Phi(d)$ is the phase function of dimension $d$

The phase function is defined as:
$$ \Phi(d) = \beta_d \times \sum_{p \in d} V(p) $$

Where:
- $\beta_d$ is the phase coefficient for dimension $d$
- $V(p)$ is the value of piece $p$

## Application in Gameplay

These operators interact to create the complete mathematical model of the game:

$$ G(t+1) = F(G(t), M(t)) $$

Where:
- $G(t)$ is the game state at time $t$
- $M(t)$ is the move made at time $t$
- $F$ is the state transition function

The state transition function incorporates all four operators:
$$ F(G(t), M(t)) = \Omega(DT, DI, SU, DR)(G(t), M(t)) $$

Where $\Omega$ is the integration function that combines the effects of all operators.

This mathematical foundation ensures that the game maintains logical consistency while enabling the rich strategic depth of multidimensional play.
