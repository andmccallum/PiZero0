OPERATOR FUNCTIONS AND MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTIONS:
---------------------------------------------------
Operator: EnviroScan
Function: Analyzes ecological, meteorological and air quality data in real time to predict environmental disruptions.
Formula: $$ES(D, A, P) = D \cdot A \cdot (1 - e^{-P})$$
where: D = Data integrity, A = Analysis accuracy, P = Predictive power.

Operator: StratoProbe
Function: Utilizes satellite imaging and high-altitude sensor data for stratospheric monitoring and anomaly detection.
Formula: $$SP(S, I, C) = S \cdot I^2 \cdot C$$
where: S = Sensor fidelity, I = Imaging resolution, C = Computational capacity.

Operator: GeoTracker
Function: Monitors ground-level phenomena including seismic and terrestrial sensor data to track geophysical events.
Formula: $$GT(G, T, R) = G \cdot \log(T+1) \cdot R$$
where: G = Ground data quality, T = Temporal frequency, R = Response coefficient.

Operator: FreqSpectrum
Function: Analyzes electromagnetic spectrum data to assess wireless signals and detect abnormal frequency emissions.
Formula: $$FS(F, N, L) = F \cdot \sqrt{N} \cdot \log(L+1)$$
where: F = Frequency range, N = Noise level, L = Logarithmic scaling factor.

Operator: DataFusionX
Function: Fuses multimodal data streams from disparate sources to create an integrated situational awareness picture.
Formula: $$DFX(M, I, S) = \frac{M + I + S}{3}$$
where: M = Multimodal input, I = Integration index, S = Sensor count.

Operator: SocioEnviro
Function: Correlates social environmental influences with real world data to derive actionable insights for public policy.
Formula: $$SE(S, E, P) = S \cdot E \cdot P$$
where: S = Social impact score, E = Environmental index, P = Public sentiment.


CONCLUSION:
-----------
The M0pi0 module has been successfully updated with additional layers covering diverse data types. The extended operator functions provide robust integrative analytics and risk management for enhanced security and decision making.
