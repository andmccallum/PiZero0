Trust Operators and Mathematical Models:
1. Trust Coefficient Operator (TCO):
   Equation: $$ T_{coef} = rac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i 	imes C_i}{n} $$
   where $w_i$ are weights of trust factors and $C_i$ are the communication reliability scores.

2. Communication Integrity Operator (CIO):
   Equation: $$ C_{integrity} = rac{S_{verified}}{S_{total}} $$
   provided that all secure channels use encrypted verification protocols.

3. Cross-Module Trust Harmonization (CMTH):
   Equation: $$ H_{trust} = \min\{T_{UIP}, T_{GIP}, T_{EIP}, \ldots\} $$
   which enforces that overall system trust is limited by the weakest link.

Implemented Operators and their Functions:
- Modal Efficiency Comparison Operator (MECO): Analyzes transportation mode efficiencies.
- Fractal Compression Operator (FCO): Reduces data footprint using fractal geometry.
- Geometric Simplification Operator (GSO): Simplifies geometric data for optimized processing.
- Communication Log and Analyzer (CLA): Logs secure communications and analyzes metadata for trust metrics.
- Trust Coefficient Operator (TCO): Quantifies trust using weighted factors.
- Communication Integrity Operator (CIO): Assesses the integrity and encryption of communications.
- Cross-Module Trust Harmonization (CMTH): Ensures consistency in trust metrics across all modules.
