IMPORTANT UPDATE: DMCHESS SOVEREIGN PIECE IMPLEMENTATION
==============================================================================

Dear DmChess Player,

We're excited to announce a significant update to all DmChess variants that will 
be deployed on [DEPLOYMENT_DATE]. This update introduces the new "Sovereign" piece, 
which replaces the traditional King and Queen with a unified, non-gendered royal piece 
that combines their movement capabilities and strategic importance.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR CURRENT GAMES:
- Active games will be paused during the update window (approximately 30 minutes)
- Upon resumption, your King and Queen pieces will be transformed into Sovereign pieces
- Game states and scores will be preserved with appropriate adjustments

NEW GAMEPLAY FEATURES:
- The Sovereign moves with a dynamic combination of King and Queen movement patterns
- Movement capabilities adjust based on game state and board position
- New strategic possibilities with the unified royal piece
- Team format in DmChessLive where the Sovereign is controlled by AI

LEARNING RESOURCES:
- Interactive tutorial available upon your next login
- 4sight assistance for early adopters
- Dynamic learning modules provided by LernPi0n

We appreciate your patience during this transition. This update represents a 
collaborative effort across all Pi0 entities to enhance your DmChess experience.
