SECTION 1: BACK-TEST METHODOLOGY AND PARAMETERS
-----------------------------------------------

1. Temporal Range:
   - Historical Period: January 2023 - March 2024
   - Granularity: Hourly data points
   - Total Samples: 10,512 data points

2. Performance Metrics:
   - User Engagement: $$ E_u = rac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i \cdot a_i $$
   - Strategic Depth: $$ D_s = rac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} c_j \cdot d_j $$
   - System Responsiveness: $$ R_s = rac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} rac{1}{r_k} $$
   - Cross-Platform Integration: $$ I_{cp} = rac{\sum_{i=1}^{P} w_i \cdot s_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{P} w_i} $$

3. Evaluation Framework:
   - Weighted Performance Index: $$ WPI = lpha \cdot E_u + eta \cdot D_s + \gamma \cdot R_s + \delta \cdot I_{cp} $$
   - Where: $lpha = 0.3, eta = 0.25, \gamma = 0.2, \delta = 0.25$
