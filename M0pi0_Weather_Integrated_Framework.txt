# Extended with Weather Data Integration

## 1. Core Operators and Mathematical Framework

### 1.1 Data Harmonization Operators

#### EPi0n Harmonization Operator (D)
- Function: `harmonize_data(df)`
- Description: Standardizes column names, removes whitespace, and converts date/time columns to a consistent format.
- Mathematical representation: 
  $$ D(X) = \{x' : x' = f_{standardize}(x), \forall x \in X\} $$

#### Timezone Fix Operator (T)
- Function: `fix_date_timezone(df, date_col)`
- Description: Converts timezone-aware datetime columns to timezone-naive to enable proper merging.
- Mathematical representation:
  $$ T(X, c) = \{x' : x'[c] = f_{tz\_naive}(x[c]), \forall x \in X\} $$

### 1.2 Data Ingestion Operators

#### Pi0 Historical Data Ingestion Operator (I_hist)
- Function: `ingest_historical_weather(filename, region)`
- Description: Loads historical weather data for a specific region.
- Mathematical representation:
  $$ I_{hist}(r) = D(T(\text{load}(\text{file}_{r}))) $$

#### WEPi0n Live Data Ingestion Operator (I_live)
- Function: `ingest_live_weather(filename, region)`
- Description: Loads live/current weather data for a specific region.
- Mathematical representation:
  $$ I_{live}(r) = D(T(\text{load}(\text{file}_{r}))) $$

### 1.3 Merge and Integration Operators

#### Pi0n Merge Operator (M)
- Function: `merge_weather_hydrometric(weather_df, hydro_df, merge_on, how)`
- Description: Merges weather and hydrometric data based on common keys.
- Mathematical representation:
  $$ M(W, H, k) = W \bowtie_k H $$
  where $\bowtie_k$ represents an outer join on key(s) $k$.

#### EPi0n Aggregation Operator (A)
- Function: `aggregate_daily(df, date_col)`
- Description: Aggregates data to daily resolution, applying appropriate functions to different types of measurements.
- Mathematical representation:
  $$ A(X, t) = \{\text{group}(X, t) \mapsto f_{agg}\} $$
  where $f_{agg}$ is a set of aggregation functions (sum for precipitation, mean for other measurements).

### 1.4 Simulation and Forecasting Operators

#### 4sight Forecasting Operator (F)
- Function: `forecast_next_year(merged_df, target_col, forecast_days)`
- Description: Forecasts values for the next year based on historical patterns.
- Mathematical representation:
  $$ F(X, c, d) = \{(t_i, \hat{y}_i) : t_i \in [t_{max}+1, t_{max}+d], \hat{y}_i = f_{forecast}(X, c, t_i)\} $$
  where $t_{max}$ is the latest date in $X$, $d$ is the forecast horizon, and $f_{forecast}$ is the forecasting function.

### 1.5 Visualization Operators

#### WEPi0n Visualization Operator (V)
- Function: `visualize_merged_data(merged_df, weather_col, hydro_col, date_col)`
- Description: Visualizes the relationship between weather and hydrometric data.
- Mathematical representation:
  $$ V(X, w, h, t) = \text{plot}(X[t], X[w], X[h]) $$

## 2. Integrated System Architecture

The M0pi0 system integrates these operators into a cohesive framework:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**:
   - Historical data (BC weather, hydrometric) is loaded via $I_{hist}$.
   - Live data (Western Canada weather) is loaded via $I_{live}$.
   - Both streams are harmonized using $D$ and $T$ operators.

2. **Data Integration Layer**:
   - Weather and hydrometric data are merged using $M$ operator.
   - Temporal aggregation is performed using $A$ operator.

3. **Simulation and Forecasting Layer**:
   - Current conditions are analyzed and future states are predicted using $F$ operator.
   - Multi-dimensional (3D/4D/5D) capabilities are enabled through extensible operator design.

4. **Visualization Layer**:
   - Integrated data is visualized using $V$ operator.
   - GIS/CAD integration for watershed mapping and flow visualization.

## 3. Adaptive Framework for Multiple Model Types

The M0pi0 framework is designed to be adaptable to various environmental modeling scenarios:

1. **Hydrological Models**:
   - Flood forecasting based on precipitation and snowmelt.
   - Watershed response modeling.
   - Reservoir management.

2. **Meteorological Models**:
   - Weather pattern analysis and prediction.
   - Climate change impact assessment.

3. **Environmental Models**:
   - Water quality monitoring and prediction.
   - Ecosystem response to environmental changes.

4. **Infrastructure Models**:
   - Flood impact on infrastructure.
   - Optimal infrastructure design for climate resilience.

## 4. Future-Proofing with 4sight

The 4sight component enables the M0pi0 framework to adapt to future needs:

1. **Adaptive Learning**:
   - The system continuously improves forecasting accuracy by learning from new data.
   - Mathematical representation:
     $$ F_{t+1} = F_t + \alpha \nabla L(F_t, X_{new}) $$
     where $\alpha$ is the learning rate and $L$ is the loss function.

2. **Multi-dimensional Expansion**:
   - 3D: Spatial distribution of hydrological and meteorological variables.
   - 4D: Temporal evolution of 3D variables.
   - 5D: Probability distributions of 4D scenarios.

3. **Integration of New Data Sources**:
   - Satellite imagery.
   - IoT sensor networks.
   - Citizen science data.

4. **Advanced Visualization**:
   - Virtual reality interfaces for immersive data exploration.
   - Augmented reality for field operations.

## 5. Continuous Data Integration Concept

The system maintains a seamless flow between historical and live data:

1. **Temporal Boundary Management**:
   - Live data is continuously integrated into the historical record.
   - Mathematical representation:
     $$ X_{hist,t+1} = X_{hist,t} \cup A(X_{live,[t,t+\Delta t]}) $$

2. **Water Year Tracking**:
   - The system maintains awareness of the current water year for proper aggregation.
   - A water year typically runs from October 1 to September 30.

3. **Data Quality Control**:
   - Automated detection and handling of anomalies.
   - Gap filling using statistical and machine learning techniques.
