   - Coin-to-fiat conversion rates
   - Revenue attribution by mining pool
   - Tax implications and obligations

3. Mining Cost Analysis:
   - Electricity costs
   - Hardware acquisition and maintenance
   - Cooling and facility expenses
   - Personnel costs for mining operations

--- MATHEMATICAL MODELS & FORMULAS ---
The framework employs sophisticated mathematical models for accurate tracking and forecasting:

1. Employee Disbursement Projection Model:
   Projected_Disbursement(t) = Base_Salary * (1 + Growth_Rate)^t + Σ(Scheduled_Bonuses) + Benefits_Cost(t) - Tax_Withholdings(t)

2. Mining Revenue Calculation:
   Daily_Revenue = (Hashrate * Block_Reward * Success_Probability * 24) - (Power_Consumption * Electricity_Cost * 24) - Daily_Operational_Costs

3. Future Revenue Stream Integration:
   Total_Projected_Revenue(t) = Mining_Revenue(t) + Σ(Additional_Revenue_Streams(t) * Confidence_Factor(t))

4. Cost Projection Model:
   Projected_Costs(t) = Fixed_Costs + Variable_Costs(t) + (Inflation_Rate * t * Affected_Costs) + Regulatory_Compliance_Costs(t)

5. Cash Flow Projection:
   Net_Cash_Flow(t) = Total_Projected_Revenue(t) - Projected_Costs(t) - Employee_Disbursements(t) - Capital_Expenditures(t)
