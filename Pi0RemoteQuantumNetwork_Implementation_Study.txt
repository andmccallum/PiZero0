================================================================================

1.1 OVERALL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Remote Quantum Network (RQN) integrates with the existing Pi0Network, creating a dual-mode infrastructure that leverages both classical and quantum communication channels:
