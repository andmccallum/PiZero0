## 5. TECHNICAL VERIFICATION PROCEDURES

### 5.1 Dimensional Shift Verification

1. **Coordinate Mapping**: All dimensional shifts must be mapped using the standard 6-dimensional coordinate system (x, y, z, t, q, s).

2. **Vector Analysis**: Shift vectors are analyzed using the Pi0 Shift Verification Algorithm:
   ```
   V_shift = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)² + (z₂-z₁)² + k₁(t₂-t₁)² + k₂(q₂-q₁)² + k₃(s₂-s₁)²]
   ```
   Where k₁, k₂, and k₃ are dimension-specific constants.

3. **Energy Calculation**: Energy expenditure is calculated and verified using:
   ```
   E_required = base_cost × dimension_factor × piece_modifier
   ```

4. **Legality Confirmation**: Shift is confirmed legal only if:
   - Coordinates are valid within game boundaries
   - Energy requirements are met
   - No rule violations occur in any dimension
   - Temporal causality is maintained

### 5.2 Quantum State Verification

For moves involving the 5th dimension (quantum states):

1. **Superposition Analysis**: Quantum state analyzer determines all possible states.

2. **Probability Calculation**: Probability of each potential outcome is calculated.

3. **Observation Protocol**: Official observation collapses the quantum state according to calculated probabilities.

4. **Verification**: Collapsed state is verified against player's declared intention.

### 5.3 Strategic Dimension Verification

For moves involving the 6th dimension (strategic plane):

1. **Strategic Value Assessment**: Objective evaluation of position before and after move.

2. **Advantage Calculation**: Quantification of strategic advantage gained or lost.

3. **Legitimacy Verification**: Confirmation that strategic shift adheres to established patterns.
