Energy Efficiency Mining Index (EEMI): 24156.55
EEMI Interpretation:
  * EEMI < 50: Low efficiency, optimization required
  * 50 ≤ EEMI < 100: Moderate efficiency
  * 100 ≤ EEMI < 150: Good efficiency
  * EEMI ≥ 150: Excellent efficiency

--- MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION ---
1. Net Power Available:
   Net_Power = Total_Generation - Total_Consumption
2. Overall Efficiency:
   Overall_Efficiency = Hardware_Efficiency * Cooling_Efficiency * Network_Efficiency
3. Exact Mining Rate:
   Mining_Rate = (Net_Power * Overall_Efficiency) / (Power_per_Hash * Difficulty_Adjustment)
4. Energy Efficiency Mining Index (EEMI):
   EEMI = (Mining_Rate / Total_Consumption) * 100
