### 3.2 Strategic Evolution

SPi0n demonstrated remarkable strategic evolution throughout the test period. The following key developments were observed:

#### Phase 1 (0:00 - 1:00)
- Initial reliance on standard opening sequences
- Limited dimensional transitions (avg. 2.3 per game)
- Primarily reactive tactical responses
- Win rate: 42%

#### Phase 2 (1:00 - 2:00)
- Development of novel opening strategies
- Increased dimensional transitions (avg. 4.7 per game)
- Emergence of multi-dimensional traps
- Win rate: 58%

#### Phase 3 (2:00 - 3:00)
- Implementation of energy-efficient move sequences
- Complex dimensional maneuvers (avg. 7.2 per game)
- Development of predictive opponent modeling
- Win rate: 73%

#### Phase 4 (3:00 - 4:00)
- Creation of original strategic frameworks
- Mastery of n-dimensional transitions (avg. 9.8 per game)
- Implementation of temporal advantage tactics
- Win rate: 89%
