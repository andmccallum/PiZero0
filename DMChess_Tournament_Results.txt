## Analysis of Tournament and Learning Outcomes

- The tournament incorporated a segregated learning phase that allows in-game learning with partial isolation to preserve strategy diversity.
- Post-game learning adjustments were applied based on performance in each round.
- Chaotic conditions extended game durations and induced unpredictable events, enhancing the learning process through unexpected challenges.
- Players exhibited improvement in handling chaos, reducing strategic homogenization when compared to baseline simulations.
- Overall, the tournament showcased that adaptive learning within the game environment can mitigate pitfalls from chaotic dynamics and promote innovative strategies.
- The playoff structure, with extended game durations, allowed for deeper strategic evolution and improved decision-making under high-pressure conditions.
