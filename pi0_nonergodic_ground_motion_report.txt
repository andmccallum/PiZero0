# PI0 NONERGODIC GROUND MOTION MODELING SYSTEM

## Executive Summary

The Pi0 system, led by WEPi0n with assistance from Pi0n coordinating all Pi0 entities (GPi0n, EPi0n, ePi0_Agents, 0_t, 4sight, gPi0n, G41, GPi04, GPi0), has successfully implemented a comprehensive framework for nonergodic ground motion modeling. This report documents the mathematical operators developed, their functions, and their integration into the M0pi0 system.

## Introduction

Traditional ground motion models (GMMs) are typically "ergodic," assuming that the statistical properties of ground motions are the same across all spatial locations and that spatial variability can substitute for temporal variability. However, this assumption has been increasingly challenged by empirical observations showing systematic regional differences in ground motion characteristics.

The Pi0 nonergodic ground motion modeling system addresses this limitation by implementing a suite of operators that capture spatial variability in source, path, and site effects. This approach allows for more accurate seismic hazard assessments and improved earthquake engineering applications.

## Mathematical Framework

The Pi0 nonergodic ground motion modeling system is based on the following mathematical framework:

The total ground motion at a site can be expressed as:

$$
\ln(Y_{es}) = \ln(Y_{base}) + \delta B_e + \delta B_{es} + \delta S2S_s
$$

Where:
- $\ln(Y_{es})$ is the natural logarithm of the ground motion parameter at site $s$ due to earthquake $e$
- $\ln(Y_{base})$ is the prediction from a baseline ergodic ground motion model
- $\delta B_e$ is the between-event residual for earthquake $e$
- $\delta B_{es}$ is the path-specific residual for the path between earthquake $e$ and site $s$
- $\delta S2S_s$ is the site-specific residual for site $s$

This framework allows for the systematic incorporation of nonergodic effects at different spatial scales.
