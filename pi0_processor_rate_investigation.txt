## Theoretical Model for Ideal Processor Rate
The ideal processor rate is modeled as:
$$ I_p = k \cdot rac{P}{L} \cdot e^{-lpha \cdot U} $$
Where:
- $P$: Processor power (arbitrary units)
- $L$: Load factor (system load)
- $U$: Utilization factor (mining resource usage)
- $k$ and $lpha$: Tuning constants (here $k=1.5$, $lpha=0.05$)

## Fractal Correction Factor
Applied as:
$$ F_c = 1 - rac{D}{10} $$
With $D$ estimated at 1.7.

## Dynamic Stability Multiplier
Applied as:
$$ M_d = 0.95 $$

## Final Ideal Processor Rate Computation
$$ I_{final} = I_p \cdot F_c \cdot M_d $$
