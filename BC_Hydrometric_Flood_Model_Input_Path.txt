Canadian Hydrometric and Snow Pillow Data Input Path for BC Flood Modeling

This document outlines the data input mechanisms required to access Canadian government hydrometric data and snow pillow data for flood modeling focused on British Columbia (BC).

1. Hydrometric Data:
   - Source: Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Water Survey of Canada
   - Datasets: Daily river flow data, water level measurements, discharge, and historical hydrometric records.
   - Access URL: https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/index_e.html
   - API/FTP Options (if available): Look for an API service or data download sections on the provided website. Use OPeNDAP or other relevant services.

2. Snow Pillow Data:
   - Source: BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, and other provincial sources.
   - Datasets: Snow water equivalent measurements, temperature readings, and continuous monitoring.
   - Access URL: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water
   - API/FTP Options: Check for provincial open data portals for BC. Data might be available via direct downloads or REST API endpoints.

3. Data Integration Plan:
   - Data Collection: Develop a script or data ingestion pipeline that periodically fetches the latest data from the above sources.
   - Data Storage: Use a database or structured file storage (CSV, JSON, or netCDF) to archive the downloaded datasets.
   - Data Preprocessing: Normalize and integrate the hydrometric data with the snow pillow data by aligning timestamps and geolocations.
   - Real-time Updates: Optionally, set up a cron job or a cloud service (e.g., AWS Lambda) to refresh the data on a daily basis.

4. Example Input Path Setup:
   - Use Python libraries (e.g., requests, pandas) to fetch and process the data.
   - Define data directories (e.g., ./data/hydrometric/ and ./data/snow_pillow/).
   - Implement error handling to manage connectivity issues and data format changes.

5. Additional Considerations:
   - Ensure compliance with data usage policies provided on the official websites.
   - Validate and clean the data as necessary before feeding it into flood prediction models.
   - Document all data sources and API endpoints used in the model.

This input path document should serve as a guide for integrating the required data streams for developing robust flood models in BC.
