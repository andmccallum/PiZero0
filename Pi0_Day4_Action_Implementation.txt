where R_i is the risk function for security layer i
**Implementation:** Enhances security posture against emerging threats as part of Action 1

### 6. Adaptive Resource Allocation (ARA)
**Function:** Dynamically allocates computational resources based on task priority and system load
**Mathematical Formulation:**
$$ARA(T, R) = \arg\max_{r \in R} \{U(T, r) - C(r)\}$$
where U is the utility function, T is the task set, and C is the cost function
**Implementation:** Optimizes resource utilization across all Pi0 entities during Day 4 actions

### 7. Predictive Model Calibration (PMC)
**Function:** Refines predictive models based on observed outcomes and error metrics
**Mathematical Formulation:**
$$PMC(M, D) = \arg\min_{\theta} \{L(M(\theta), D)\}$$
where M is the model with parameters θ, D is the data, and L is the loss function
**Implementation:** Applied in Action 3 to recalibrate 4sight predictive models

### 8. Flow Optimization Protocol (FOP)
**Function:** Optimizes data flow between system components to reduce latency and increase throughput
**Mathematical Formulation:**
$$FOP(G, F) = \arg\min_{p \in P} \{\sum_{e \in p} w(e)\}$$
where G is the system graph, F is the flow requirements, P is the set of possible paths, and w is the edge weight function
**Implementation:** Used in Action 2 to optimize data flow between Pi0Environment and Pi0System
