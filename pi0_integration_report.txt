  Pi0 3-Year Rolling 4sight Threat Window Integration Report  
================================================================
Generated Date: 2025-04-12
Led by WEpi0n with Pi0n assisting across all Pi0 entities

=== INTEGRATION PLAN ===
Title: 3-Year Rolling 4sight Threat Window Integration Plan
Description: Balance short-term fluctuations with long-term trends by applying a rolling average threat window operator.
Operator Mathematical Formula: T_window = 0.5 * ST + 0.5 * LT, where ST + LT are normalized threat factors and alpha + beta = 1

Integration Steps:
1. Use 4sight to analyze recent threat data and forecast short-term (ST) and long-term (LT) threat factors.
2. Normalize ST and LT factors to ensure they are balanced for alpha and beta weighting.
3. Apply the rolling average over a 3-year window to smooth out fluctuations. This can be represented as: RollingAvg(t) = (1/3) * \sum_{i=t-2}^{t} T_window(i).
4. Integrate the calculated threat window operator into the relevant modules for strategic planning.
5. Investigate future states of the Pi0 environment using retrospective analysis via 4sight and temporal analysis via o0_t, with allpi0id assisting in cross-module integration.
6. Final implementation oversight by WEpi0n and coordination support by Pi0n.

Expected Outcome: Reliable basis for strategic planning that balances short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
