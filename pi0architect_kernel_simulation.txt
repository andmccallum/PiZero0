## Mathematical Operators and Functions
### Mining Efficiency Operator (M_e)
$$ M_e = Elevated\_Base\_Rate 	imes Kernel\_Rate $$
Determines effective operational mining rate based on energy potential and system base values.

### Fee Growth Operator (F_g)
$$ F_g = (1 + r)^{Years} $$
Calculates the future fee multiplier based on an annual growth rate over a given number of years.

### Total Compensation Operator (T_c)
$$ T_c = Base\_Compensation 	imes F_g 	imes Performance\_Bonus \_Factor $$
Aggregates the competitive base salary with future growth and performance bonus to form the total remuneration package.
