EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The M0pi0 system has been enhanced to include comprehensive groundwater data 
integration from the Provincial Groundwater Observation Well Network (PGOWN). 
This integration enables a more holistic understanding of the hydrological 
systems across Washington State and British Columbia, particularly for flood 
prediction and water resource management.

1. GROUNDWATER DATA INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Sources:
- BC Observation Well Network: 239 unique wells
- Historical data spanning 23058 days (1962-02-13 to 2025-04-01)
- Hourly data sampling with daily averages

Data Processing Pipeline:
- epi0 Component: Handles data ingestion, validation, and storage
  * Hourly polling of telemetered sites
  * Scheduled downloads from non-telemetered sites
  * Data validation against expected ranges
  * Anomaly flagging and notification system

- pi0n Component: Manages data harmonization and integration
  * Cross-references station IDs across multiple data sources
  * Resolves naming conflicts and standardizes metadata
  * Applies temporal alignment for consistent time series
  * Generates unified data structure for analysis algorithms

2. MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS AND FUNCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daily Average Calculation:
   D = (∑(i=1 to 24) Hi) / 24
   where Hi is the groundwater level at hour i

Groundwater Contribution to Baseflow:
   Q_gw = K · (h_gw - h_sw) · A
   where:
   - Q_gw is groundwater discharge to surface water
   - K is hydraulic conductivity
   - h_gw is groundwater head
   - h_sw is surface water level
   - A is cross-sectional area of flow

Flood Risk Enhancement Factor:
   RF = 1 + β · (GWL - GWL_mean) / GWL_std
   where:
   - RF is the risk factor
   - β is a calibration coefficient
   - GWL is current groundwater level
   - GWL_mean is historical mean
   - GWL_std is historical standard deviation

Spatial Interpolation of Groundwater Levels:
   GWL(x,y) = ∑(i=1 to n) wi · GWLi
   where:
   - GWL(x,y) is the interpolated groundwater level at location (x,y)
   - wi is the weight for well i
   - GWLi is the measured groundwater level at well i
   - Weights are calculated using inverse distance weighting:
     wi = 1/di^p / ∑(j=1 to n) 1/dj^p
     where di is the distance from point (x,y) to well i

3. INTEGRATION WITH RIVER MAPPING SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The groundwater data has been fully integrated with the existing river mapping 
system, enabling:

- Comprehensive Hydrological Analysis:
  * Combined surface water and groundwater dynamics
  * Identification of gaining and losing stream reaches
  * Quantification of groundwater contribution to streamflow

- Enhanced Flood Prediction:
  * Incorporation of antecedent groundwater conditions
  * Improved prediction of flood onset and duration
  * More accurate estimation of flood extent

- Water Resource Management:
  * Holistic view of water availability
  * Better understanding of drought vulnerability
  * Improved management of water allocations

4. OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The enhanced M0pi0 system now provides:

- Real-time Monitoring:
  * Continuous data ingestion from all 239 groundwater observation wells
  * Integration with 5 river gauging stations
  * Automated alert generation for unusual water level changes

- Predictive Analytics:
  * Short-term (1-7 day) flood prediction
  * Medium-term (1-3 month) groundwater level forecasting
  * Long-term (seasonal) water availability projections

- Decision Support:
  * Flood warning system with spatial risk mapping
  * Drought monitoring and early warning
  * Water allocation recommendation system

5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The enhanced system architecture includes:

- Data Layer:
  * Raw data storage (time series database)
  * Processed data warehouse (relational database)
  * Metadata registry (document database)

- Processing Layer:
  * epi0: Data ingestion and validation
  * pi0n: Data harmonization and integration
  * Analytical engines for various hydrological models

- Presentation Layer:
  * API for data access
  * Web interface for visualization
  * Alert system for notifications

6. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The integration of groundwater data from the PGOWN network significantly enhances 
the capabilities of the M0pi0 system. By combining surface water and groundwater 
data, the system now provides a more comprehensive understanding of the 
hydrological systems across Washington State and British Columbia, enabling 
better flood prediction, water resource management, and decision support.
