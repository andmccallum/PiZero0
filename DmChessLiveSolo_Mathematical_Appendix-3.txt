## Formal Definitions of Game Operators

### 1. Dimensional Transfer Operator (DT)

$$ DT(p, d_1, d_2) = T(p, d_1) \rightarrow T(p, d_2) $$

Where:
- $p$ is the piece being transferred
- $d_1$ is the origin dimension
- $d_2$ is the destination dimension
- $T(p, d)$ represents the state of piece $p$ in dimension $d$

The transfer operation is subject to the following constraints:
$$ DT(p, d_1, d_2) = \begin{cases}
T(p, d_1) \rightarrow T(p, d_2), & \text{if } (x,y) \in P \\
\text{undefined}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where $P$ is the set of portal coordinates: $\{(3,3), (3,6), (6,3), (6,6)\}$.

For Nexus pieces, the portal set is expanded:
$$ P_{Nexus} = P \cup \{(x,y) | (x,y) \text{ is occupied by a Nexus piece}\} $$

### 2. Influence Field Operator (IF)

$$ IF(p, d_1, d_2) = V(p) \times \frac{1}{D(d_1, d_2)} $$

Where:
- $p$ is the piece exerting influence
- $d_1$ is the origin dimension
- $d_2$ is the target dimension
- $V(p)$ is the base value of piece $p$
- $D(d_1, d_2)$ is the dimensional distance between $d_1$ and $d_2$

The base values of pieces are defined as:
- Sovereign: 9
- Rook: 5
- Knight: 3
- Bishop: 3
- Pawn: 1
- Nexus: 7
- Shifter: 4

The dimensional distance function is defined as:
$$ D(d_1, d_2) = |d_1 - d_2| + 1 $$

Where dimensions are assigned numerical values:
- Material: 1
- Ethereal: 2
- Conceptual: 3
- Temporal: 4

### 3. Portal Resonance Operator (PR)

$$ PR(x, y, d_1, d_2) = \alpha \times (x^2 + y^2) \times |d_1 - d_2| $$

Where:
- $(x,y)$ are the coordinates of the portal
- $d_1, d_2$ are the dimensions being connected
- $\alpha$ is the resonance coefficient (default value: 0.01)

The resonance value affects the strategic value of using specific portals for dimensional transfers.

### 4. Sovereign Unity Operator (SU)

$$ SU(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{4} (P(S, d_i) \times N(d_i)) $$

Where:
- $S$ is the Sovereign piece
- $P(S, d_i)$ is the power function of the Sovereign in dimension $d_i$
- $N(d_i)$ is the number of friendly pieces in dimension $d_i$

The power function is defined as:
$$ P(S, d_i) = \begin{cases}
9, & \text{if } S \text{ is in dimension } d_i \\
4.5, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

## Application in Gameplay

These operators interact to create the complete mathematical model of the game:

$$ G(t+1) = F(G(t), M(t)) $$

Where:
- $G(t)$ is the game state at time $t$
- $M(t)$ is the move made at time $t$
- $F$ is the state transition function

The state transition function incorporates all four operators:
$$ F(G(t), M(t)) = \Omega(DT, IF, PR, SU)(G(t), M(t)) $$

Where $\Omega$ is the integration function that combines the effects of all operators.

This mathematical foundation ensures that the game maintains logical consistency while enabling the rich strategic depth of multidimensional play.
