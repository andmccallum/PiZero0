--- wave_cancellation ---
W = A*sin(ωt + ϕ)
 where A is amplitude, ω is angular frequency, t is time and ϕ is phase shift

--- h2zero0_cube ---
Q = ψ¸ (ρ/φ)
 Quantum properties relate to entanglement level and dimensional stability

--- black_hole_outlet ---
E = mc^2 - ΔE
 where ΔE accounts for energy recycled through the black hole feedback loop

--- mobius_loop ---
L = ∞ (mod 2)
 represents the one-sided nature of energy conservation in the loop
