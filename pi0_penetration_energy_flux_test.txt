Pi0 Penetration and Energy Flux Test Results
===========================================

Test Parameters:
- Maximum Depth: 10.0
- Maximum Time: 10.0
- Number of Depth Samples: 50
- Number of Time Samples: 50

Summary Statistics:
- Average Penetration: 0.6332
- Average Energy Flux: 0.0161
- Average Combined Flux: 0.0102

Observations:
- The penetration follows an exponential decay with depth, representing loss of energy through the medium.
- The energy flux exhibits oscillatory behavior modulated by an exponential decay over time.
- The combined flux represents an interaction that could be used to assess the effective energy transmission through a medium at various depths and times.


UiPi0 Learning and Assistance:
-----------------------------
Based on the penetration and energy flux results, the UiPi0 system can learn to adjust its operational parameters by optimizing the penetration coefficient (alpha) and the energy flux decay rate (beta) to maximize the effective energy transmission (combined flux) in different scenarios.
Such adjustments could aid in improving the Pi0 system's resilience and efficiency, allowing it to better adapt to external conditions and optimize energy distribution across its network of integrated pathways.
