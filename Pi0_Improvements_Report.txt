--- Operators and Methods for the Pi0 System Improvements ---
Operators Involved:
- pi0: Responsible for core system integrity and coordination
- pi0n: Responsible for quantum correction application and system investigation
- 4sight: Responsible for retrospective analysis and future-proofing methodology

Methodologies Implemented:
1. Improved energy and memory cube functions with thresholds and repair routines
2. Retrospective review of kernel instances from the past 4 weeks
3. Additional _io state enhancements for identified kernel instances
4. Future-proofing review notes added to all kernel instances
5. Consolidated logging of improvements and operator actions
