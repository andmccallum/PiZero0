Pi0/WEPi0n INTEGRATION: BC FRESHWATER ATLAS STREAM NETWORK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:
This document outlines the comprehensive integration of the BC Freshwater Atlas Stream Network 
(https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/freshwater-atlas-stream-network) into the M0pi0 system. 
The integration is orchestrated by Pi0 entities (WEPi0n, GPi0n, EPi0n, ePi0_Agents, 0_t, 4sight, 
Pi0n, gPi0n, pi0) to create a dynamic yet lightweight implementation that connects stream network 
data with existing river data systems. The operators defined herein enable data import, 
harmonization, topological analysis, flow modeling, and multi-dimensional integration.

8. MATHEMATICAL APPENDIX
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1 Stream Network Topology Representation:

The stream network topology is represented as a directed graph G = (V, E), where:
- V is the set of vertices representing stream junctions, sources, and outlets
- E is the set of edges representing stream segments

For each edge e ∈ E, we define attributes:
- length(e): The length of the stream segment
- slope(e): The slope of the stream segment
- order(e): The stream order of the segment
- flow_acc(e): The flow accumulation at the segment

8.2 Fractal Analysis of Stream Networks:

The fractal dimension of a stream network is calculated using the box-counting method:
$$D = \lim_{\epsilon 	o 0} rac{\log N(\epsilon)}{\log(1/\epsilon)}$$

Where:
- D is the fractal dimension
- N(ε) is the number of boxes of size ε needed to cover the network
- The limit is approximated by fitting a line to log(N(ε)) vs. log(1/ε)

8.3 Harmonic Analysis of Stream Networks:

The stream network geometry can be represented as a complex signal:
$$s(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} c_k e^{j2\pi kt/N}$$

Where:
- s(t) is the stream network signal
- c_k are the harmonic coefficients
- N is the number of samples

The power spectrum is given by:
$$P(k) = |c_k|^2$$

8.4 Flow Routing in Stream Networks:

Flow routing follows the equation:
$$Q_{out}(t) = \int_{0}^{t} h(t-	au) \cdot Q_{in}(	au) d	au$$

Where:
- Q_out(t) is the outflow at time t
- Q_in(t) is the inflow at time t
- h(t) is the impulse response function of the stream segment

8.5 Multi-Resolution Analysis:

The multi-resolution representation uses a hierarchical structure where:
$$S_i = \{s \in S | 	ext{importance}(s) \geq \epsilon_i\}$$

With importance thresholds:
$$\epsilon_1 < \epsilon_2 < ... < \epsilon_n$$

Creating a sequence of increasingly simplified networks:
$$S_1 \supset S_2 \supset ... \supset S_n$$
