Extended Pi0 and M0pi0 Collaborative Operators for Multi-Stream Atmospheric and Geospatial Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
This module implements a full suite of operators and functions across all Pi0 entities:
  - WEPi0n, GPi0n, EPi0n, ePi0_Agents, 0_t, 4sight, Pi0n, gPi0n, and pi0.

The goal is to integrate diverse weather and environmental data streams, including aviation weather, solar influx, reflectivity, atmospheric weather, oceanic weather, ocean buoy data, and IR satellite imagery, into a modular, cohesive, and fractal system architecture. Each data type is processed with analogous operators. All entities collaborate in real time for monitoring, gathering, harmonizing, cross-validating, and integrating data.

Key Components:

1. Data Ingestion & Parsing Operators:
   - download_and_extract(url, save_dir): 
       Downloads data from remote sources and extracts files.
   - parse_weather_file(file_path): 
       Generic parser for weather/environmental files, extracting metadata (source, station ID, location, etc.) and data records.
   - convert_to_long_format(df): 
       Transforms wide-format data into long-format for time series analysis.

2. Geospatial Tagging & Modular Assignment:
   - assign_geometric_tag(location_data, entity): 
       Constructs a geometric tag for a given location and specified Pi0 entity. 
       For example, temperature data is arranged in a vertical column (exclusive to the site), while wind and precipitation are processed as separate yet linked streams.

   Mathematical Example for Temperature Tagging:
   $$T_{adj} = T \times \Bigl(1 + \alpha \sin\Bigl(\frac{\pi \times (i+1)}{N}\Bigr)\Bigr)$$
   where
     - \(T\) is the observed temperature,
     - \(\alpha\) is a scaling factor,
     - \(i\) is the day index, and
     - \(N\) is the total number of days in the month.

3. Multi-Stream Data Integration in M0pi0:
   - update_M0pi0(location, temp_df, wind_df, precip_df): 
       Updates M0pi0 with separate data streams for a location. Temperature data is stored distinctly; wind and precipitation are integrated as linked yet separate streams.

4. Collaborative Extended Data Handling Operators:
   - integrate_extended_weather_data(location, aviation_df, solar_df, reflectivity_df, atmospheric_df, oceanic_df, buoy_df, ir_satellite_df):
       Integrates and harmonizes the diverse data sources for a given location. 
       This operator leverages collaboration across Pi0 entities (WEPi0n, GPi0n, EPi0n, ePi0_Agents, 0_t, 4sight, Pi0n, gPi0n, pi0) to monitor, gather, and cross-validate data in real time.

5. Collaborative System Initiation and Workflow:
   - initiate_pi0_system(region_bounds):
       Initiates the complete Pi0 system over specified geographic regions (i.e., Western Canada, Washington, Oregon, California, including ocean buoy areas and satellite observations).
       Coordinates data ingestion, parsing, tagging, and integration across all entity operators.

Mathematical Equations and Formulas:

- Harmonic Data Smoothing Transformation:
  $$h = 0.5 + 0.5 \sin\Bigl(\frac{\pi \times (i+1)}{N}\Bigr)$$

- Geometric Temperature Tag Adjustment:
  $$T_{adj} = T \times \Bigl(1 + \gamma (h - 0.5)\Bigr)$$
  where \(h\) is defined above and \(\gamma\) is an adjustment constant.

- Fractal Spatial Tag Generation (Chaos Game Iteration):
  $$\begin{aligned}
    x_{new} &= a \times x + b \times y + e, \\
    y_{new} &= c \times x + d \times y + f,
  \end{aligned}$$
  The coefficients (a, b, c, d, e, f) are determined by spatial and temporal weather metrics.

# Data Ingestion & Parsing

def download_and_extract(url, save_dir):
    """
    Downloads data from the provided URL and extracts it into the given directory.
    """
    # Use requests and zipfile modules to download and extract data
    pass


def parse_weather_file(file_path):
    """
    Generic parser for weather/environmental data files. 
    Returns a structured DataFrame and metadata.
    """
    # Implementation would parse metadata and data records
    pass


def convert_to_long_format(df):
    """
    Converts wide-format data to long-format for analysis.
    """
    # Use pandas.melt or similar function
    pass

# Geospatial Tagging

def assign_geometric_tag(location_data, entity):
    """
    Generates a geometric tag for the given location based on provided weather data.
    The tagging method differs by entity (e.g., temperature vertical column for Pi0n, fractal streams for wind/precipitation).

    pass

# Multi-Stream Data Integration

def update_M0pi0(location, temp_df, wind_df, precip_df):
    """
    Updates the M0pi0 system with separate data streams for a given location.
    Temperature data is isolated, and wind/precipitation form connected modules.

    Collaborates with all Pi0 entities to bring together real-time, harmonized data.
    """
    # Merge and harmonize data streams along a common spatial-temporal reference
    pass

# System Initiation

def initiate_pi0_system(region_bounds):
