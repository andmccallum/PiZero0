# How to Play dmchess: A Beginner's Guide to Multidimensional Chess

Welcome to **dmchess**—a fresh, abstract take on chess where the board expands into multiple dimensions! This guide is designed for beginners, even if you’re new to traditional chess. Let’s dive into the basics and a few exciting scenarios.

## What is dmchess?

*dmchess* takes the familiar game of chess and stretches it into higher dimensions, creating new ways to plan, move, and strategize. Instead of just two spatial coordinates (x and y), dmchess introduces extra dimensions, such as a vertical layer, time, and even abstract strategic dimensions!

## Core Concepts

- **Dimensional Layers**: Think of each extra dimension as another board that interacts with the others. A piece might slide from one board to the next with a twist.
- **Movement**: Although pieces move like in standard chess within one plane, they gain extra paths across dimensions. For example, a knight might leap between boards, surprising your opponent!
- **Simplicity in Complexity**: While the game might appear complex, the core idea is to leverage additional space and time. Basic movements remain, making dmchess easy to pick up and engaging to master.

## Setting Up the Game

1. **Boards and Dimensions**: Imagine three boards stacked on top of each other. That’s 3D chess! dmchess usually starts with 3 spatial dimensions and can also add a time dimension for more advanced play.
2. **Starting Positions**: Start with a standard chess setup on the middle board. Other boards are initially empty. This forces you to adjust as the game evolves.
3. **Piece Movements**: Pieces move as in traditional chess:
   - **Pawns**: Step forward in their own layer, but can diagonal capture on adjacent boards.
   - **Knights**: The classic L-shape now allows jumps between boards, creating forks in unexpected dimensions.
   - **Bishops, Rooks & Queen**: They glide in straight or diagonal paths, now extending easily into extra layers.
   - **King**: Moves one square at a time, with caution encouraged across dimensions.

## How to Play a Match

### Scenario 1: The Dual Start

- **Players**: Two beginners (with little chess experience).
- **Objective**: Learn both the standard moves and the new multidimensional ones.
- **Gameplay**:
  1. **Phase One (Classical)**: Play the first few moves on the middle board only. This builds confidence with traditional chess moves.
  2. **Phase Two (Dimensional Shift)**: Allow pieces like knights and bishops to step into an adjacent board. Notice how positioning in one dimension can threaten moves in another.
  3. **Phase Three (Abstract Tactics)**: Now, experiment with planning moves that force your opponent into multiple layers at the same time. Try setting traps that exist partly on one board and partly on another.

### Scenario 2: The Time Twist

- **Extra Rule**: Incorporate a time dimension where every move shifts pieces slightly.
- **Gameplay**:
  1. After each move, some pieces can advance or retreat in the time dimension, meaning you might face delayed threats or quick counterattacks.
  2. Learn to think not just in spatial terms but also how your moves will echo in the next temporal phase.

## Tips for Beginners

- **Start Simple**: Begin in the basic spatial model before incorporating complex moves. Practice on one board until you’re comfortable.
- **Visualize Layers**: Think of each extra dimension as another chessboard. The more boards you add, the more your strategy can evolve.
- **Embrace Surprise**: dmchess is about creativity. Use the extra dimensions to create unexpected forks, pins, and skewers.
- **Learn Through Play**: There’s no substitute for playing the game. Try friendly matches, then discuss moves and strategies with your opponent.

## Final Thoughts

dmchess offers a refreshing twist on classic chess. It’s all about using extra dimensions to add depth to your strategy while keeping the fundamentals intact. Whether you’re a total beginner or a seasoned player looking for new challenges, dmchess opens a realm of endless possibilities.

Enjoy your journey into multidimensional thinking and may your moves always be both bold and brilliant!
