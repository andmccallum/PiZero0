## G^4^4 Decision Matrix Structure

The G^4^4 decision matrix represents a nested matrix structure with four levels of depth, where each element at each level is itself a matrix. This creates a hyperdimensional decision space capable of representing complex ethical considerations across multiple domains.

Structure:
- Level 1: Core ethical principles matrix (4×4)
- Level 2: Contextual application matrices (16 matrices, each 4×4)
- Level 3: Stakeholder impact matrices (256 matrices, each 4×4)
- Level 4: Temporal consequence matrices (4,096 matrices, each 4×4)

This results in a total of 65,536 decision points, each representing a unique ethical consideration within the decision-making framework.

Mathematical representation:
$$
G^{4^4} = \{M_{ijkl} \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4} \mid i,j,k,l \in \{1,2,3,4\}\}
$$

Where each $M_{ijkl}$ is a 4×4 matrix representing a specific ethical decision context.
