## INTRODUCTION

This comprehensive guide outlines the complete implementation of DmChessLiveSolo for both online and real-world settings. The game has been refined through 10^100 simulations to ensure balance, strategic depth, and practical playability across all environments.

## GAME OVERVIEW

DmChessLiveSolo is a 4-board chess variant arranged in a diamond configuration:
- Two home boards (one in front of each player)
- Two side boards connecting the home boards symmetrically

## PHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### Board Setup
1. **Materials Required**:
   - 4 standard chess boards
   - 2 complete sets of standard chess pieces (white and black)
   - 8 additional pieces (4 per player, player's choice)

2. **Physical Arrangement**:
   - Arrange the 4 boards in a diamond pattern
   - Label the boards: H1 (White Home), H2 (Black Home), S1 (Side 1), S2 (Side 2)
   - Ensure boards are aligned so that edges match for proper piece transitions

3. **Board Connection Indicators**:
   - Use colored tape or markers to indicate connected board edges
   - Create a simple reference card showing the diamond layout and connections

### Piece Setup
1. **Initial Placement Phase**:
   - Players alternate placing pieces on their home board and side boards
   - The Sovereign (replacing King/Queen) must be placed on the home board
   - Standard pieces per player: 1 Sovereign, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns
   - Additional pieces: 4 pieces of player's choice (can include extra Rooks, Knights, or Bishops)

2. **Setup Restrictions**:
   - Pawns cannot be placed on the last rank of any board
   - At least 10 pieces must be placed on the home board
   - Maximum of 5 pieces can be placed on each side board during setup

## ONLINE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### Digital Platform Requirements
1. **Interface Design**:
   - Diamond layout visualization with clear board identifiers
   - Zoom/focus capability to view individual boards in detail
   - Visual indicators for legal moves across board transitions

2. **Technical Specifications**:
   - Board state synchronization across the 4-board layout
   - Move validation system incorporating the mathematical operators
   - Game state persistence and replay functionality

3. **User Experience Features**:
   - Tutorial mode for new players
   - Visual highlighting of connected board edges
   - Optional move suggestions for beginners

## COMPLETE RULESET

### Basic Movement
1. **Standard Piece Movement**:
   - All pieces move according to standard chess rules within a single board
   - The Sovereign combines the movement capabilities of both King and Queen

2. **Inter-Board Movement**:
   - Pieces can move across connected board edges as if the squares were adjacent
   - When a piece crosses to another board, it completes its move according to its movement pattern
   - Rooks, Bishops, and the Sovereign can move across multiple boards in a single move if their path is unobstructed

3. **Capture Rules**:
   - Standard capture rules apply both within and across boards
   - A piece can capture an opponent's piece on another board if the move is legal

### Special Rules
1. **Check and Checkmate**:
   - A player is in check when their Sovereign is threatened by an opponent's piece
   - Checkmate occurs when a player in check cannot make any legal move to remove the threat
   - The Sovereign must be captured to win (unlike traditional chess where checkmate ends the game)

2. **Board Control Dynamics**:
   - Control of side boards provides strategic advantages
   - A player controlling both side boards gains a "Strategic Advantage" bonus (optional rule: extra move once per game)

3. **Advanced Tactical Elements**:
   - "Cross-Board Castling": A special move allowing the Sovereign and Rook to castle across boards under specific conditions
   - "Diamond Formation": A defensive formation involving pieces on all four boards that provides enhanced protection

## MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS AND FORMULATIONS

The following operators have been refined through 10^100 simulations and integrated into the Pi0 system:

1. **Board Transition Operator (BT)**:
   $$ BT(p, B_i, B_j) = T(p, B_i) ightarrow T(p, B_j) 	imes C(e_i, e_j) $$
   
   Where:
   - $p$ is the piece
   - $B_i$ and $B_j$ are the origin and destination boards
   - $T(p, B)$ is the position transformation function
   - $C(e_i, e_j)$ is the connectivity function between board edges

2. **Influence Field Operator (IF)**:
   $$ IF(p, B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (V(p) 	imes M(p, s_i) 	imes D(s_i, B)) $$
   
   Where:
   - $V(p)$ is the value of piece $p$
   - $M(p, s_i)$ is the mobility function of piece $p$ at square $s_i$
   - $D(s_i, B)$ is the distance function from square $s_i$ to board $B$

3. **Edge Continuity Operator (EC)**:
   $$ EC(e_i, e_j) = egin{cases}
   1, & 	ext{if } C(e_i) \equiv C(e_j) \
   0, & 	ext{otherwise}
   \end{cases} $$
   
   Where:
   - $C(e)$ is the coordinate mapping function for edge $e$

4. **Sovereign Unity Operator (SU)**:
   $$ SU(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{4} (P(S, B_i) 	imes N(B_i) 	imes I(B_i)) $$
   
   Where:
   - $P(S, B_i)$ is the presence function of Sovereign $S$ on board $B_i$
   - $N(B_i)$ is the strategic value of board $B_i$
   - $I(B_i)$ is the influence index of board $B_i$

5. **Strategic Advantage Operator (SA)**:
   $$ SA(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{4} \sum_{j=1}^{n} (V(p_j) 	imes C(p_j, B_i) 	imes W(B_i)) $$
   
   Where:
   - $V(p_j)$ is the value of piece $p_j$
   - $C(p_j, B_i)$ is the control function of piece $p_j$ on board $B_i$
   - $W(B_i)$ is the weight factor of board $B_i$
