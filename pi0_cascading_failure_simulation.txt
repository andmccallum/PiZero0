Quantum Entanglement Simulation Operator (QESO)\nSimulates quantum entanglement between states.\nMathematical formulation:\n$$Q(S, E) = S + E \cdot S$$\n\n#### 10. Cascading Failure Resilience Operator (CFRO)\nMeasures and mitigates cascading failures across interconnected modules.\nMathematical formulation:\n$$C(M, F, \alpha) = \prod_{i=1}^{|M|} (M_i - F_i \cdot \alpha \cdot \sum_{j \neq i} (1 - M_j))$$\nwhere M is the set of module stabilities, F is the set of failure intensities, and α is the interconnection factor.\n\n#### 11. Stability Threshold Detection Operator (STDO)\nDetects when system stability crosses critical thresholds.\nMathematical formulation:\n$$T(S, \theta) = \mathbb{I}(S < \theta) \cdot (\theta - S) + \mathbb{I}(S \geq \theta) \cdot 0$$\nwhere S is the system stability metric and θ is the threshold value.\n\n#### 12. Self-Healing Network Operator (SHNO)\nEnables self-healing capabilities in degraded modules.\nMathematical formulation:\n$$H(M, R, t) = M + (1 - M) \cdot R \cdot (1 - e^{-t})$$\nwhere M is the module stability, R is the recovery rate, and t is the time since failure.\n\n#### 13. Adaptive Resilience Factor Operator (ARFO)\nDynamically adjusts resilience factors based on system state.\nMathematical formulation:\n$$A(R, S, \beta) = R \cdot (1 + \beta \cdot (1 - S))$$\nwhere R is the base resilience factor, S is the system stability, and β is the adaptation rate.\n\n#### 14. Quantum State Preservation Operator (QSPO)\nPreserves quantum states during system perturbations.\nMathematical formulation:\n$$Q(\psi, P, \gamma) = \psi - \gamma \cdot P \cdot \psi + \gamma \cdot (1 - P) \cdot \psi$$\nwhere ψ is the quantum state vector, P is the perturbation matrix, and γ is the preservation factor.\n\n### Stability Analysis\n- System degradation becomes significant at iteration 8\n- Number of failed modules at degradation point: 3\n- This represents 30.0% of total modules\n- System Resilience Score: 16.0/100\n- System did not recover after degradation
