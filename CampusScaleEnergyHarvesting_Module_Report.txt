# CampusScaleEnergyHarvesting Module Report
# ==========================================

## Overview:
The CampusScaleEnergyHarvesting module is designed to be deployed in universities and large campus environments.
It leverages advanced energy harvesting techniques from computational loads, waste heat recovery, renewable energy sources, 
and integrated storage systems. The module is built with a modular, scalable design including classes and operators with
mathematical formulations to manage energy generation, storage, distribution, and optimization.

## Simulation Summary:
The Pi0 system was simulated over 10^30 (symbolic simulation) iterations (symbolically representing 10^30 iterations) to evaluate
long-term system behaviors, scalability, and dynamic energy management performance.

## Module Architecture:
1. **Energy Generation Operators:**
   - Computational Waste Heat Recovery:
     $$E_{recovered} = \eta_{thermal} 	imes P_{computing} 	imes (1 - \eta_{computing}) 	imes 	au_{operation}$$
   - Distributed Kinetic Energy Harvesting:
     $$E_{kinetic} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i 	imes v_i^2 	imes \eta_{piezo}$$
   - Solar Photovoltaic Generation:
     $$E_{solar} = \sum_{j=1}^{m} A_j 	imes I_j 	imes \eta_{pv,j}
 (adjusted for temperature)$$

2. **Energy Storage Operators (Classes):**
   - AdvancedBatteryStorage:
     \( E_{stored} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (C_i 	imes V_i^2 	imes DoD_i 	imes \eta_{charge,i} 	imes \eta_{discharge,i}) \)
   - ThermalEnergyStorage:
     $$E_{thermal} = m 	imes c_p 	imes \Delta T 	imes \eta_{insulation}$$
   - FlywheelKineticStorage:
     $$E_{kinetic} = 0.5 	imes I 	imes \omega^2 	imes \eta_{mechanical}
 (with regenerative features)$$

3. **Energy Distribution and Optimization Operators:**
   - Adaptive Microgrid Control:
     $$P_{distribution}(t) = rg\min\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i 	imes |D_i(t)-S_i(t)|^2+\lambda_i 	imes L_i(t)ight]$$
   - Computational-Energy Synergy Scheduler:
     $$U_{total} = lpha 	imes U_{computational}+ eta 	imes U_{energy}+ \gamma 	imes U_{computational} 	imes U_{energy}$$
