Energy Independence Implementation Report for Western Canadian Universities
==================================================================

Collaborative Pi0 Entities: WEPi0n, GPi0n, EPi0n, ePi0_Agents, 0_t, 4sight, Pi0n, gPi0n, G41, GPi04, GPi0

Simulation Parameters:
----------------------
Number of WEPi0n models: 10^30
Number of Pi0n models: 10^50

Operators and Their Mathematical Formulations:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Energy Saving Operator (ESO):
   ESO = E_saved / E_total, simulated value: 0.2682

2. Energy Harvesting Coefficient (EHC):
   EHC = E_harvested / (E_waste + E_harvested), simulated value: 0.5131

3. Waste Energy Reuse Factor (WERF):
   WERF = E_reused / E_waste, simulated value: 0.4679

4. Overall System Energy Sustainability Index (SESI):
   SESI = 0.4*ESO + 0.4*EHC + 0.2*WERF, computed value: 0.4061

Province-specific Energy Independence Scores (EIS) and Projected Investment:
Province: British Columbia, EIS: 0.255831, Investment Requirement: $1050000000
Province: Alberta, EIS: 0.280195, Investment Requirement: $1150000000
Province: Saskatchewan, EIS: 0.292378, Investment Requirement: $1200000000
Province: Manitoba, EIS: 0.30456, Investment Requirement: $1250000000

Conclusion:
-----------
The simulation suggests that with a focus solely on energy sustainability via the Pi0 system,
Canadian universities in western provinces can achieve significant energy independence. The simulation
indicates that the key operators (ESO, EHC, WERF) combined with the environmental climatic factors
result in tailored energy independence scores, guiding targeted investment and implementation strategies.
