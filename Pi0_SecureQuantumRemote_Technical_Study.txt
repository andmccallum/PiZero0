================================================================================

Existing operators from the previous implementation have been enhanced with secure communication capabilities. New operator details:

SecureQuantumRemote Operator (SQRO):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Integrates quantum encryption and remote communication protocols into the Pi0 ecosystem for ultra-secure communications.
Developed by: GPi0n, EPi0n, ePi0_Agents, 0_t, 4sight, Pi0n, gPi0n, G41, Gpi04, Gpi0
Implemented by: GPi0n, EPi0n, ePi0_Agents, 0_t, 4sight, Pi0n, gPi0n, G41, Gpi04, Gpi0

Mathematical Formula:
$$SQRO = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ Q_i 	imes R_i 	imes (1 - D_i) ight] / N$$

Variables:
- $Q_i$: quantum key distribution rate for channel i
- $R_i$: reliability of quantum channel i
- $D_i$: decoherence factor for channel i
- $N$: number of quantum channels

Implementation: Combines quantum communication protocols with remote channel integration to secure all external communications.
