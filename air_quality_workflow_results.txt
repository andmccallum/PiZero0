Report Date: 2025-04-02 15:39:15

WORKFLOW SUMMARY:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Raw Data Collection:
   - Collected data from 7 monitoring sites across 7 air zones
   - Raw data size: 480 records with 13 parameters
   - Memory usage: 0.10 MB

2. Data Quarantine:
   - Applied contamination detection algorithms
   - Identified 0 sites with potential data quality issues
   - Average contamination score: 0.012

3. Data Harmonization:
   - Applied adjustments based on contamination scores
   - Integrated wind factors to adjust pollutant concentrations

4. Data Lightening:
   - Reduced data precision and aggregated to hourly intervals
   - Final data size: 480 records
   - Memory usage: 0.12 MB
   - Achieved -22.1% memory reduction

5. Air Quality Index:
   - Calculated simplified AQI for each zone
   - Zones with highest AQI: Central Interior (73.4)
   - Zones with lowest AQI: Peace (46.3)

6. Vertical Air Analysis:
   - Estimated inversion layer heights based on surface temperature
   - Calculated vertical impact factors for pollutant trapping
   - Zone with highest vertical impact: Okanagan (1.23)

CONCLUSIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The workflow successfully demonstrates how air quality data can be gathered, 
quarantined, harmonized, and lightened while extracting essential information about 
air quality conditions and vertical air structure. The memory footprint was reduced 
by -22.1% while maintaining the ability to 
derive meaningful air quality indices and vertical air layer analysis.

This approach allows for efficient modeling of air movement and the layer of air 
between the ground surface and higher atmosphere cloud density without storing 
excessive data in memory.
