  Disadvantages: Group identification overhead, Potential for group imbalance

Multiplicity Approach:
  Description: Execute directives with multiple approaches simultaneously and select the best result
  Formula: $$E_{mult}(D) = \arg\max_{E_k \in \{E_{seq}, E_{rand}, E_{group}\}} Q(E_k(D))$$
  Advantages: Highest adaptability, Best performance across various directive types
