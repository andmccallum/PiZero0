# MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK FOR Pi01HELPER AND Pi02SOLVER INTEGRATION
==================================================================

## 1. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### 1.1 Pi01Helper System Definition

The Pi01Helper system operates as a novice-friendly assistance mechanism that provides simple yet effective move suggestions without significantly altering the game's strategic depth. The system is defined by the following mathematical framework:

The Pi01Helper function H can be expressed as:

H(G, P, t) = argmax_{m ∈ M(G,t)} [α·V_imm(m) + β·S(m) + γ·E_eff(m)]

Where:
- G represents the current game state
- P represents the player's historical patterns and skill level
- t represents the current turn number
- M(G,t) is the set of all legal moves at state G and turn t
- V_imm(m) is the immediate value function of move m
- S(m) is the simplicity function of move m
- E_eff(m) is the energy efficiency of move m
- α, β, and γ are weighting coefficients that adjust based on game phase

The weighting coefficients evolve throughout the game according to:

α(t) = α_0 · (1 - t/t_max)^k_α
β(t) = β_0 · (1 - t/t_max)^k_β
γ(t) = γ_0 · (1 + t/t_max)^k_γ

Where:
- t_max is the expected game length
- k_α, k_β, and k_γ are decay/growth constants
- α_0, β_0, and γ_0 are initial coefficient values

### 1.2 Pi02Solver System Definition

The Pi02Solver provides two distinct move options weighted for immediate versus long-term advantage, requiring energy expenditure proportional to the decision complexity. The system is defined by:

The Pi02Solver function S can be expressed as:

S(G, P, t, E_avail) = {m_imm, m_long} where:

m_imm = argmax_{m ∈ M(G,t)} [ω_1·V_imm(m) + ω_2·E_eff(m)]
m_long = argmax_{m ∈ M(G,t)} [ω_3·V_long(m) + ω_4·E_pot(m)]

Subject to:
E_cost(m_imm, m_long) ≤ E_avail

Where:
- E_avail is the player's available energy
- V_imm(m) is the immediate value function of move m
- V_long(m) is the long-term value function of move m
- E_eff(m) is the energy efficiency of move m
- E_pot(m) is the potential energy generation of move m
- ω_1, ω_2, ω_3, and ω_4 are weighting coefficients

The energy cost function E_cost is defined as:

E_cost(m_imm, m_long) = λ · D(m_imm, m_long) · C(G)

Where:
- D(m_imm, m_long) is the strategic divergence between the two moves
- C(G) is the complexity factor of the current game state

## 9. CONCLUSION

This mathematical framework provides the foundation for integrating Pi01Helper and Pi02Solver into DmChess gameplay. The equations and operators defined here enable these assistance systems to provide valuable learning support while maintaining game integrity and promoting skill development.

The Pi01Helper system offers accessible guidance for novices and early-game situations, while the Pi02Solver system provides more sophisticated decision support at an appropriate energy cost. Both systems are designed to gradually reduce their influence as player skill increases, ensuring that they serve as learning tools rather than permanent crutches.

Tournament compliance is maintained through automatic deactivation in official competitive settings, with clear fallback mechanisms for time expiration situations.
