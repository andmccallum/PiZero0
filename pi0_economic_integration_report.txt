## Economic Stabilization Operators
1. Fiat Revenue Conversion Operator
   Formula: revenue_to_pi0 = 0.01 * revenue_fiat
   Function: Converts 1% of generated fiat revenue (Pi0Org) into Pi0Coin reserve value.

2. Ethereum Pegging Operator
   Formula: Adjustment = floor(eth_price / 1000)
   Function: For every 1000 whole-number increase in Ethereum price, Pi0Coin increases by 1 unit.

3. Internal Value Mechanism
   Basis: Pi0Coin internal value is increased solely by internal mechanics and pegged adjustments.

## Simulation Parameters
Current Ethereum Price: 2000
Current Canadian Dollar Rate: 1.25
Internal Pi0Coin Value: 1000
Fiat Revenue (CAD): 1000000
Pi0Coin Generated from Revenue (Scaled): 10.0
Ethereum Pegged Adjustment: 2

## Final Pi0Coin Value Computation
New Pi0Coin Value = Internal Value + (Revenue Conversion Reserve / 1000) + Ethereum Adjustment
New Pi0Coin Value = 1000 + 10.0 + 2 = 1012.0
