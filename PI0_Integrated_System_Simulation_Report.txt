## Mathematical Framework & Operators

// PI0 System Mathematical Framework

// Controller Effectiveness Function:
E(c,t) = E_base(c) \cdot L(t) + F(t)

// System Security Function:
S(t) = (lpha \cdot ar{E}(t) + eta \cdot A(t)) \cdot (1 - \gamma \cdot T(t))

// Diversity-Stability Balance Equation:
B(c) = \omega_D \cdot D(c) + \omega_S \cdot S(c)

// Routing Optimization Equation:
R(p) = \sum_{(i,j) \in p} W_{ij} 
where W_{ij} is the edge weight between nodes i and j, and p is the path.

// Dynamic Rerouting Condition:
If external condition Q affects the network, then
W'_{ij} = W_{ij} * (1 + \delta Q_{ij})
