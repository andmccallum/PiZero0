Operator Implementations:

1. Fractal Harmonic Mapping Operator (FHMO):
   Equation: x_i * (sin(r * iteration/10) * exp(-r/3) + 0.001 * sum(|x|^k)) with k = 2 + iteration*(complexity - 1)
2. Quantum Foam Generator Operator (QFGO):
   Equation: F(x,y,z,t) = sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i sin(omega_i t + phi_i) exp(-((x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2+(z-z_i)^2)/(2 sigma_i^2)) * O(x,y,z,t)
3. Recursive Observer Mapping Operator (ROMO):
   Equation: R(O,S,d) = O ⊕ S ⊕ (O ⊗ S)/d
4. Fractal Uncertainty Propagator Operator (FUPO):
   Equation: U(s,n,alpha) = s + sum_{i=1}^{n} (alpha^i/i!) * F(s,i)
5. Agravitational Well Dynamics Operator (AWDO):
   Equation: A(p,C,S) = p + sum_{i=1}^{m} (S_i*(p-C_i))/||p-C_i||^3
6. Observer Superposition State Operator (OSSO):
   Equation: S(n,epsilon) = 1/sqrt(n) * sum_{i=1}^{n} exp(i theta_i)|i> ⊗ sum_{j=1}^{n} epsilon_{ij}|j>
7. Temporal Dynamics Operator (TDO):
   Equation: T(s) = s * exp(-time_factor)
