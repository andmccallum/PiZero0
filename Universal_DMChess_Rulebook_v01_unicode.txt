1️⃣ INTRODUCTION
───────────────
1.1 DMChess (Dimensional Multi-Chess) is an 8-dimensional chess variant that extends traditional chess into multiple interconnected dimensions.

1.2 This rulebook (Version 01) serves as the definitive reference for all official DMChess play.

1.3 DMChess combines traditional chess strategy with spatial reasoning across multiple dimensions, creating a game of unprecedented depth and complexity.

2️⃣ GAME COMPONENTS
─────────────────
2.1 BOARDS
  2.1.1 The game consists of 8 interconnected 8×8 boards, each representing a distinct dimension.
  2.1.2 Each board is labeled D1 through D8 for identification.
  2.1.3 Boards are arranged in a cube-like configuration with dimensional portals connecting them.

2.2 PIECES
  2.2.1 Each player begins with 16 standard pieces per dimension:
    • 1 King (♔/♚)
    • 1 Queen (♕/♛)
    • 2 Rooks (♖/♜)
    • 2 Knights (♘/♞)
    • 2 Bishops (♗/♝)
    • 8 Pawns (♙/♟)
  2.2.2 Pieces are distinguished by color (Light and Dark) and dimensional markers.
  2.2.3 Each piece has a dimensional energy level (DEL) ranging from 1-8.

2.3 DIMENSIONAL PORTALS
  2.3.1 Portals connect corresponding squares across different dimensions.
  2.3.2 Portal locations are fixed at the start of the game but may shift according to Section 6.1.
  2.3.3 Portals are bidirectional unless otherwise specified.

3️⃣ DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE
─────────────────────
3.1 DIMENSIONAL HIERARCHY
  3.1.1 The 8 dimensions exist in a non-linear relationship.
  3.1.2 Dimensions D1-D3 form the Primary Cluster.
  3.1.3 Dimensions D4-D6 form the Secondary Cluster.
  3.1.4 Dimensions D7-D8 form the Tertiary Cluster.

3.2 DIMENSIONAL ENERGY
  3.2.1 Each dimension has a base energy level corresponding to its number.
  3.2.2 Energy levels affect piece movement capabilities across dimensions.
  3.2.3 Energy transfer between dimensions follows the Conservation Law (Section 6.2).

3.3 DIMENSIONAL MAPPING
  3.3.1 Adjacent dimensions share more portals than distant dimensions.
  3.3.2 The dimensional distance formula is: Dist(Dₐ,Dᵦ) = |a-b|.
  3.3.3 Portal density between dimensions Dₐ and Dᵦ equals 64/(Dist(Dₐ,Dᵦ)+1).

4️⃣ PIECE MOVEMENT
───────────────
4.1 STANDARD MOVEMENT
  4.1.1 Within a single dimension, pieces move according to traditional chess rules.
  4.1.2 Kings (♔/♚) move one square in any direction.
  4.1.3 Queens (♕/♛) move any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
  4.1.4 Rooks (♖/♜) move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
  4.1.5 Bishops (♗/♝) move any number of squares diagonally.
  4.1.6 Knights (♘/♞) move in an L-shape: two squares horizontally or vertically, then one square perpendicular.
  4.1.7 Pawns (♙/♟) move one square forward (toward opponent's side) and capture diagonally.

4.2 DIMENSIONAL MOVEMENT
  4.2.1 Pieces may move across dimensions via portals if their DEL is sufficient.
  4.2.2 To traverse from dimension Dₐ to Dᵦ, a piece must have DEL ≥ |a-b|.
  4.2.3 Dimensional movement counts as one move, plus any moves made in the destination dimension.
  4.2.4 Pieces cannot end their move in a portal square.

4.3 DIMENSIONAL ENERGY LEVEL (DEL)
  4.3.1 Each piece begins with a DEL equal to its starting dimension.
  4.3.2 DEL can be increased by occupying energy squares (Section 5.3).
  4.3.3 Maximum DEL for any piece is 8.
  4.3.4 When a piece captures another piece, it gains 1 DEL (up to the maximum).

5️⃣ GAME MECHANICS
───────────────
5.1 GAME SETUP
  5.1.1 Players choose Light or Dark pieces.
  5.1.2 Initial piece placement follows traditional chess arrangement on each dimension.
  5.1.3 Players may distribute their Kings across any dimensions before play begins.
  5.1.4 The Light player moves first.

5.2 TURN SEQUENCE
  5.2.1 Players alternate turns.
  5.2.2 Each turn consists of exactly one move with one piece.
  5.2.3 A move may include dimensional travel as per Section 4.2.
  5.2.4 Players cannot pass their turn.

5.3 ENERGY SQUARES
  5.3.1 Each board contains 8 energy squares marked with "E".
  5.3.2 A piece ending its move on an energy square increases its DEL by 1.
  5.3.3 Energy squares recharge 3 turns after being used.
  5.3.4 A piece cannot gain energy from the same square twice consecutively.

5.4 CAPTURE
  5.4.1 Pieces capture as in traditional chess by moving to a square occupied by an opponent's piece.
  5.4.2 Captured pieces are removed from play.
  5.4.3 Capturing a piece grants +1 DEL to the capturing piece.
  5.4.4 Pieces can capture across dimensions if the move is otherwise legal.

6️⃣ SPECIAL RULES
──────────────
6.1 DIMENSIONAL SHIFT
  6.1.1 After every 8 full turns (both players), portal locations shift according to the Dimensional Shift Table (Appendix A).
  6.1.2 Players receive notification one turn before a shift occurs.
  6.1.3 Pieces occupying a portal square during a shift are moved to the nearest unoccupied non-portal square.

6.2 CONSERVATION LAW
  6.2.1 The sum of all DELs on each dimension must remain within ±8 of the dimension's base energy.
  6.2.2 If this law would be violated, the move is illegal.
  6.2.3 The Conservation Law does not apply during the first 16 moves of the game.

6.3 CASTLING
  6.3.1 Castling follows traditional chess rules within a single dimension.
  6.3.2 Cross-dimensional castling is permitted if:
    • Both the King and Rook have not moved.
    • All squares between them (including portal paths) are unoccupied.
    • The King is not in check and does not pass through check.
    • Both pieces have sufficient DEL for the dimensional travel.
  6.3.3 Cross-dimensional castling counts as a dimensional move.

6.4 EN PASSANT
  6.4.1 En passant captures follow traditional chess rules within a single dimension.
  6.4.2 En passant cannot be performed across dimensions.

6.5 PAWN PROMOTION
  6.5.1 Pawns promote upon reaching the eighth rank of any dimension.
