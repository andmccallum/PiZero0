%% Pi0 SYSTEM OPERATORS FOR TRUST AND COMMUNICATION                     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

OPERATOR: Trust Coefficient Operator (TCO)
FUNCTION: Analyze and quantify trust relationships between Pi0 entities
EQUATION: $$ T_{coef} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \times C_i}{n} $$
IMPLEMENTATION: Implemented using weighted factors including authentication integrity, communication security, and operational consistency.

OPERATOR: Communication Integrity Operator (CIO)
FUNCTION: Assess the integrity and security of communications across channels
EQUATION: $$ C_{integrity} = \frac{S_{verified}}{S_{total}} \times \prod_{i=1}^{m} E_i $$
IMPLEMENTATION: Evaluates verification success rates and encryption strength across multiple channels.

OPERATOR: Cross-Module Trust Harmonization (CMTH)
FUNCTION: Ensure consistent trust evaluation across all Pi0 modules
EQUATION: $$ H_{trust} = \min\{T_{UIP}, T_{GIP}, T_{EIP}, \ldots\} $$
IMPLEMENTATION: Enforces that overall system trust is limited by the weakest link.

OPERATOR: Temporal Trust Decay Operator (TTDO)
FUNCTION: Model the natural decay of trust over time without verification
EQUATION: $$ T_{decay}(t) = T_{initial} \times e^{-\lambda (t - t_0)} $$
IMPLEMENTATION: Encourages regular verification by modeling trust decay over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPERATOR: Multi-Dimensional Trust Integration Operator (MDTIO)
FUNCTION: Combine trust scores across multiple dimensions
EQUATION: $$ T_{integrated} = \sqrt[d]{\prod_{i=1}^{d} T_i} $$
IMPLEMENTATION: Uses geometric mean to ensure low trust in any dimension impacts overall score.
