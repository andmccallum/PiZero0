        adaptive_risk += weight * (baseline + prediction)
    
    return adaptive_risk
```

Risk Prediction Model:
The 4sight-enabled prediction uses a multi-factor model:

$$

    max_utility = 0
    
    for strategy in strategies:
        message_utility = 0
        resource_cost = SMALL_CONSTANT
        
        for i, message in enumerate(messages):
            delivery_prob = calculate_delivery_probability(message, strategy)
            message_utility += message.importance * delivery_prob

        utility = message_utility / resource_cost
        if utility > max_utility:
            max_utility = utility
            optimal_strategy = strategy
    
    return optimal_strategy
```

Energy Optimization Model:
The energy consumption is modeled as:

$$
E_{total}(C) = E_{fixed} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} E_{transmission}(M_i, C) + \sum_{j=1}^{m} E_{processing}(P_j, C)
