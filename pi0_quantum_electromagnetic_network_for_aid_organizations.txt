## Core System Architecture

### 1. Quantum-Electromagnetic Convergence Framework
The QEM-Net is built on a foundational framework that unifies quantum and electromagnetic principles:

$$

Where $\parallel$ denotes parallel operation with cross-domain synchronization and information transfer.

### 3. Energy-Communication Integration
The QEM-Net uniquely integrates energy provision and communication:
