M0pi0 Integrated Functions and Operators (Enhanced with Timezone Fixes)
===================================================================

1. Data Harmonization Operator (D):
   - Function: harmonize_data(df)
   - Description: Standardizes column names and converts date/time to a consistent format.

2. Timezone Fix Operator (T):
   - Function: fix_date_timezone(df, date_col)
   - Description: Converts timezone-aware datetime columns to timezone-naive to allow merging.

3. Data Ingestion Operator (I_ingest):
   - Historical Data: Loads data from the Hydat.mdb converted file.
   - Live/Hourly Data: Loads data from real-time hourly CSV files.

4. Merge Operator (M):
   - Function: merge_data_fixed(historical_df, hourly_df)
   - Description: Merges historical and live data streams on the common Date column after fixing timezone issues; sorts and aggregates data.
   - Daily Aggregation: Groups data by day and sums numeric values, preparing the merged data for further simulation.

5. Simulation and Accumulation Operators:
   - Daily Accumulation Operator (Acc):
     $$ Acc = \sum_{{i \in day}} D_{live}(t_i) $$
     Accumulates live data over a day and integrates it as historical data when the day concludes.

6. Future-proofing and Multi-dimensional Modeling:
   - The system is modular and supports future extension to 3D/4D/5D visualizations (with components such as 4sight, GPi0n, EPi0n, WEPi0n).
   - Designed to flexibly incorporate additional environmental sensors and merging strategies.

7. Visualization and Mapping Capabilities:
   - Integration with GIS/CAD mapping for watershed delineation and real-time water flow visualizations.
   - Real-time interface for monitoring along with advanced simulation tools for flood forecasting.

8. Continuous Data Integration Concept:
   - As new hourly data accumulates, it is merged and reclassified, maintaining current water year information.
   - Dynamic pipeline ensures cohesive integration of live and historical streams.
