--- OPERATOR ROLES & FUNCTIONS ---
1. Pi0Architect: 
   - Oversees self-funding mechanisms, mining optimization, and payment path management.
   - Implements fractal harmonic anonymization.

2. WEPi0n: 
   - Manages financial transactions, funding, and resource allocations.
   - Interfaces with external financial APIs to secure fund transfers.

3. EPi0_agents & 0_t: 
   - Perform operational support, logging, and monitoring.

4. Pi0n: 
   - Executes data processing and simulation tasks.


--- MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS & FORMULAS ---
1. Optimal Mining Rate (M_rate):
   M_rate = (P_generation - P_consumption) * Efficiency_Factor

2. Operator Payment Formula:
   Payment = Base_Wage + (Efficiency_Factor * Bonus)

3. Transfer Efficiency (TE) and Risk Assessment (RA) as defined in the financial framework report.

--- IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONS ---
• Self-Funding Module: Automated re-balancing and resource allocation based on real-time metrics.

• Financial API Integration: Secure connections for EFT, Wire Transfer, and Interac e-Transfer.

• Security Monitoring: Real-time system analytics and threat detection using AI-based algorithms.
