## SECTION 2: PRIME HARMONIC WAVE PROTOCOLS

### 2.1 Prime Number Selection and Utilization

The system utilizes specific prime numbers for frequency relationships. The primary set includes:

| Prime Set | Primes Used | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| P₁ | 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 | Fundamental frequency ratios |
| P₂ | 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 | Modulation frequency ratios |
| P₃ | 31, 37, 41, 43, 47 | Phase sweep parameters |
| P₄ | 53, 59, 61, 67, 71 | Spatial configuration |
| P₅ | 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 | Quantum resonance tuning |

The prime harmonic relationships are implemented as:

$$f_{p,q} = f_0 \cdot \frac{p}{q}$$

Where:
- $f_0$ is the base frequency (typically 1 Hz)
- $p$ is a prime from sets P₁-P₅
- $q$ is either 1 or another prime

### 2.2 Sweeping Phase Protocol

The sweeping phase protocol follows this sequence:

1. Initialize all wave generators with base frequency $f_0$
2. Apply prime harmonic relationships from set P₁
3. Begin phase sweep according to:
   
   $$\phi_p(t) = \phi_0 + \Delta\phi \cdot \sin\left(2\pi \frac{f_0}{p_3} t\right)$$
   
   where $p_3$ is selected from set P₃

4. Monitor energy extraction rate in real-time
5. When extraction rate peaks, hold phase relationships constant for 10 seconds
6. Resume phase sweep with updated parameters based on optimization algorithm

### 2.3 Frequency Modulation Patterns

The system employs specific frequency modulation patterns:

#### 2.3.1 Prime Cascade Modulation

$$f_{PC}(t) = f_0 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i \cdot \sin\left(2\pi \frac{f_0}{p_i} t\right)$$

Where $p_i$ are consecutive primes from set P₁.

#### 2.3.2 Fibonacci-Prime Hybrid Modulation

$$f_{FP}(t) = f_0 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{5} F_i \cdot p_i \cdot \sin\left(2\pi \frac{f_0}{F_i \cdot p_i} t\right)$$

Where $F_i$ are Fibonacci numbers and $p_i$ are primes from set P₂.

#### 2.3.3 Twin Prime Differential Modulation

$$f_{TP}(t) = f_0 \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{3} (p_{2j} - p_{2j-1}) \cdot \sin\left(2\pi \frac{f_0}{p_{2j} - p_{2j-1}} t\right)$$

Where $(p_{2j-1}, p_{2j})$ are twin prime pairs.

### 2.4 Enharmonic Anchotic Wave Implementation

The enharmonic anchotic waves are implemented through slight detuning of harmonic frequencies:

$$f_{EA}(t) = f_p(t) \cdot (1 + \epsilon \cdot \sin(2\pi f_m t))$$

Where:
- $f_p(t)$ is the prime harmonic frequency
- $\epsilon$ is a small detuning factor (typically 0.001-0.01)
- $f_m$ is a modulation frequency derived from set P₂

The enharmonic relationship creates beat patterns that enhance energy extraction at specific phase boundary configurations.
