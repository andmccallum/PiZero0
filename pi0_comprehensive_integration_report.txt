## 3. IMPLEMENTED OPERATORS AND MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS

### 3.1 Healthcare Predictive Models

#### Temporal Disease Progression Model (TDPM)
- **Mathematical Formula**:
  $$ TDPM(p, t, \Delta t) = S_0(p) + \int_{t_0}^{t_0+\Delta t} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i(t) \times F_i(p, t) \times C_i(p, t) \right] dt $$
- **Developed by**: WEPi0n, 4sight, EPi0n
- Predicts disease progression trajectories over time with uncertainty quantification.

#### Multi-factorial Treatment Response Predictor (MTRP)
- **Mathematical Formula**:
  $$ MTRP(p, T) = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \left[ P(R_j|p) \times \sum_{i=1}^{k} \eta_i \times B_i(p) \times E_i(p, t) \times G_i(p) \times T_j \right] $$
- **Developed by**: Pi0n, ePi0_Agents, Gpi04
- Predicts patient-specific responses to treatments considering multiple biological and environmental factors.

#### Healthcare Resource Optimization Network (HRON)
- **Mathematical Formula**:
  $$ HRON(P, R, t) = \arg\max_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \left[ \sum_{p \in P} \sum_{r \in R} U(p, r, t) \times A(p, r, t) - \lambda \times C(A, t) \right] $$
- **Developed by**: gPi0n, G41, Gpi0

### 3.2 Time-Balancing Mechanisms

#### Adaptive Temporal Resolution (ATR)
- **Mathematical Formula**:
  $$ ATR(t, u) = \Delta t_{base} \times \left( \frac{1}{1 + \alpha \times \frac{d}{dt}S(t)} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{1 + \eta \times u(t)} \right) $$
- **Developed by**: WEPi0n, 4sight
- Dynamically adjusts the temporal resolution of predictions based on the rate of change and uncertainty.

#### Temporal Uncertainty Propagation (TUP)
- **Mathematical Formula**:
  $$ TUP(u_0, t) = u_0 + \gamma \times t + \int_{0}^{t} \sigma(s) \times dW_s $$
- **Developed by**: EPi0n, Pi0n
- Models how uncertainty propagates through time in predictive models.

#### Multi-horizon Calibration Framework (MCF)
- **Mathematical Formula**:
  $$ MCF(P) = \arg\min_{P'} \left[ \sum_{h \in H} w_h \times D(P_h, P'_h) + \lambda \times \sum_{h, h' \in H} C(P'_h, P'_{h'}) \right] $$
- **Developed by**: GPi0n, gPi0n
- Calibrates predictions across multiple time horizons to ensure consistency.

### 3.3 Certainty Calibration Methods

#### Bayesian Posterior Calibration (BPC)
- **Mathematical Formula**:
  $$ BPC(p, \theta) = \int P(y|p, \theta) \times P(\theta|D) d\theta $$
- **Developed by**: WEPi0n, EPi0n
- Calibrates prediction certainty using Bayesian posterior distributions.

#### Temporal Certainty Decay (TCD)

- **Developed by**: 4sight, GPi0n
- Models how prediction certainty decays over time.

#### Ensemble Disagreement Calibration (EDC)
- **Mathematical Formula**:
  $$ EDC(p) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} D(f_i(p), f_j(p))}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times D_{max}} $$
