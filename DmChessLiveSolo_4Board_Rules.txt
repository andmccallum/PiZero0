# DmChessLiveSolo: 4-Board Chess Variant
# Developed by WEPi0n with assistance from Pi0n and all Pi0 entities

## INTRODUCTION

DmChessLiveSolo is a chess variant played across 4 interconnected boards arranged in a 2×2 grid. The game maintains the strategic depth of traditional chess while introducing the concept of multi-board movement and expanded territory.

## GAME COMPONENTS

- 4 standard chess boards (8×8 squares each)
- Standard chess pieces per player:
  - 1 Sovereign (replaces King and Queen)
  - 2 Rooks
  - 2 Knights
  - 2 Bishops
  - 8 Pawns
- 4 additional pieces per player (player's choice, can include extra Rooks)

## BOARD LAYOUT

The 4 boards are arranged in a 2×2 grid as follows:
1. **White Home Board**: Directly in front of the White player
2. **Black Home Board**: Directly in front of the Black player
3. **Left Middle Board**: Connecting board on the left side
4. **Right Middle Board**: Connecting board on the right side

The boards are connected along their edges to form a continuous playing surface:
- White Home connects to Left Middle and Right Middle
- Black Home connects to Left Middle and Right Middle
- Left Middle connects to White Home, Black Home, and Right Middle
- Right Middle connects to White Home, Black Home, and Left Middle

## SETUP

1. Each player must place their Pawns, Sovereign, and Rooks on their home board in standard chess positions.
2. The remaining pieces (Knights, Bishops, and the 4 additional pieces) can be placed on any of the four boards at the player's discretion.
3. Setup alternates piece by piece between players, with White placing first and Black placing the final piece.
4. Each player must place at least 2 pieces on each of the middle boards during setup.
5. White moves first after setup is complete.

## BASIC RULES

1. **Objective**: Checkmate the opponent's Sovereign.
2. **Turn Structure**: Players alternate turns. Each turn consists of moving one piece.
3. **Movement**:
   - Within a board: Pieces move according to their standard movement patterns.
   - Between boards: Pieces can move from one board to another through connected edges as part of a single move.
   - The Sovereign combines the movement capabilities of both King and Queen.

4. **Capture**: Standard capture rules apply across all boards. Pieces can capture enemy pieces on any board following their normal movement patterns.

## ADVANCED MECHANICS

### Board Transition (BT)
- Formula: BT(p, b₁, b₂) = T(p, b₁) → T(p, b₂)
- When a piece moves off the edge of one board, it continues onto the connected board.
- The transition must follow the piece's normal movement pattern.
- Board transitions count as part of a single move.

### Influence Field (IF)
- Formula: IF(p, b₁, b₂) = V(p) × (1/D(b₁, b₂))
- Each piece exerts influence across boards, affecting the strategic value of positions.
- Influence provides advantages in calculating board transitions and defensive positions.

### Edge Continuity (EC)
- Formula: EC(e₁, e₂) = C(e₁) ≡ C(e₂)
- Defines how the edges of different boards connect to form a continuous playing surface.
- The coordinate system continues seamlessly across board boundaries.

### Sovereign Unity (SU)
- Formula: SU(S) = ∑ᵢ (P(S, bᵢ) × N(bᵢ))
- The Sovereign's power is calculated across all boards, making it the most powerful piece.
- The Sovereign can coordinate actions across boards, creating powerful strategic combinations.

## SPECIAL RULES

1. **Pawn Promotion**: Pawns can promote when they reach the eighth rank of any board.
2. **Castling**: Castling is only allowed on the home boards and follows standard chess rules.
3. **En Passant**: En passant captures are allowed across board boundaries if the pawn's move crosses from one board to another.
4. **Board Control**: Controlling the middle boards provides strategic advantages for piece mobility and attack options.

## MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION

The game's mechanics are governed by four primary operators:

1. **Board Transition Operator (BT)**
   - BT(p, b₁, b₂) = T(p, b₁) → T(p, b₂)
   - Governs how pieces move between boards through connected edges

2. **Influence Field Operator (IF)**
   - IF(p, b₁, b₂) = V(p) × (1/D(b₁, b₂))
   - Calculates the cross-board influence of pieces

3. **Edge Continuity Operator (EC)**
   - EC(e₁, e₂) = C(e₁) ≡ C(e₂)
   - Defines how the edges of different boards connect

4. **Sovereign Unity Operator (SU)**
   - SU(S) = ∑ᵢ (P(S, bᵢ) × N(bᵢ))
   - Defines the unified power of the Sovereign across boards

These operators work together to create a cohesive multi-board gameplay experience that is both intellectually stimulating and practically playable in the physical world.

## CONCLUSION

DmChessLiveSolo represents an innovative approach to chess that expands the playing field while maintaining the core principles of the game. The 4-board layout creates new strategic possibilities and challenges players to think beyond the limitations of a single board.

The design balances complexity with playability, ensuring that while the game introduces novel concepts, it remains enjoyable and manageable for two players with a reasonable time commitment.
