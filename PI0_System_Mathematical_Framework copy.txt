  $$ D_F(\rho, \phi) = \nabla \cdot (\rho \nabla \phi) - \kappa \rho \phi $$
  Balances system density and flux during extreme load conditions, where ρ is system density and φ is flux potential.

Gravity-Chaos Harmonization Operator (G_C):
  $$ G_C(g, c) = \frac{g \cdot c}{\sqrt{g^2 + c^2}} \cdot \Omega(g, c) $$
  Harmonizes gravitational effects with chaos factors in the system, where g is gravity factor and c is chaos intensity.
