--- Mathematical Formulations ---
Pi0Coin Exponential Growth:
  $$V(t) = V_0 \cdot e^{r t}$$, where, V_0 = initial value, r = annual growth rate, t = time in years.
Pi0Market Exponential Growth:
  $$M(t) = M_0 \cdot e^{g t}$$, where, M_0 = initial market value, g = market growth rate, t = time in years.

--- Entity Integration and Testing ---
