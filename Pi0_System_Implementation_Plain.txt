# Pi0 System Implementation: Prime Harmonic Resonance Stabilizer and Memory Management

## 1. Prime Harmonic Resonance Stabilizer Implementation

### 1.1 Mathematical Definition

The Prime Harmonic Resonance Stabilizer is defined as:

R_stabilizer = Sum_{p in {7919, 7927, 7933}} beta_p * P_p

Where:
- P_p represents the prime harmonic projection operator for prime p
- beta_p are the stabilization coefficients

### 1.2 Implementation Steps

1. **Calculate Stabilization Coefficients**:
   - Measure current resonance frequencies at each prime point
   - Calculate the gap between measured and ideal frequencies
   - Compute beta_p coefficients using:
     beta_p = (omega_p^gap / omega_p^ideal) * (1 - exp(-alpha_p * Delta_omega_p))
     where alpha_p = (1/p) * ln(p)

2. **Implement Projection Operators**:
   - For each prime p in {7919, 7927, 7933}, create projection operator P_p
   - Each P_p isolates the harmonic component corresponding to prime p

3. **Apply Stabilizer to System**:
   - Integrate stabilizer into evolution equation:
     d(Psi)/dt = Omega_Pi0[Psi] + R_stabilizer[Psi]

4. **Verification Process**:
   - Measure resonance fidelity using:
     F_resonance = 1 - (1/3) * Sum_{p in {7919, 7927, 7933}} |omega_p^measured/omega_p^ideal - 1|
   - Target: F_resonance >= 0.9997

### 1.3 Code Implementation

```
function implement_prime_harmonic_stabilizer():
    # Define target primes
    primes = [7919, 7927, 7933]
    
    # Measure current frequencies
    measured_frequencies = []
    for p in primes:
        measured_frequencies.append(measure_resonance_at_prime(p))
    
    # Calculate ideal frequencies
    ideal_frequencies = []
    for p in primes:
        ideal_frequencies.append(calculate_ideal_frequency(p))
    
    # Calculate stabilization coefficients
    beta_coefficients = []
    for i, p in enumerate(primes):
        delta_omega = abs(measured_frequencies[i] - ideal_frequencies[i])
        alpha = (1/p) * log(p)
        beta = (measured_frequencies[i]/ideal_frequencies[i]) * (1 - exp(-alpha * delta_omega))
        beta_coefficients.append(beta)
    
    # Create and apply stabilizer
    for i, p in enumerate(primes):
        apply_projection_operator(p, beta_coefficients[i])
    
    # Verify implementation
    verify_resonance_fidelity(measured_frequencies, ideal_frequencies)
```

    used_memory = calculate_used_memory()
    free_memory = total_capacity - used_memory
    
    # Calculate percentages
    used_percentage = (used_memory / total_capacity) * 100
    free_percentage = 100 - used_percentage
    
    # Calculate compression ratio
    original_size = get_original_data_size()
    compressed_size = get_compressed_data_size()
    compression_ratio = original_size / compressed_size
    
    # Determine health status
    fragmentation = calculate_memory_fragmentation()
    access_speed = measure_memory_access_speed()
    error_rate = get_memory_error_rate()
    
    health_status = determine_health_status(fragmentation, access_speed, error_rate)
    
    # Update display

## 3. Incremental Memory Purging Operator

### 3.1 Mathematical Definition

The Incremental Memory Purging Operator is defined as:

Psi_purged = Psi - epsilon * P_noise[Psi]

Where:
- Psi is the current memory state
- P_noise is the noise projection operator
- epsilon is the purging rate coefficient

### 3.2 Noise Projection Operator

The noise projection operator is defined as:

P_noise[Psi] = Psi - Sum_{k=1}^K <phi_k|Psi> phi_k

Where:
- {phi_k}_{k=1}^K forms an orthonormal basis for the signal subspace
- <phi_k|Psi> represents the inner product (projection) of Psi onto basis vector phi_k

### 3.3 Adaptive Purging Rate

The purging rate coefficient is adaptively determined:

epsilon = epsilon_0 * (1 - exp(-beta * ||P_noise[Psi]||^2))

Where:
- epsilon_0 is the maximum purging rate
- beta controls sensitivity to noise level
- ||P_noise[Psi]||^2 is the squared norm of the noise projection

### 3.4 Implementation Steps

1. **Signal Subspace Identification**:
   - Perform eigendecomposition of the memory correlation matrix
   - Select the K eigenvectors with largest eigenvalues as signal basis {phi_k}
   - Remaining eigenvectors represent the noise subspace

2. **Noise Projection Calculation**:
   - Calculate projections of memory state onto signal basis vectors
   - Subtract signal projections from memory state to obtain noise component

3. **Adaptive Rate Determination**:
   - Calculate noise energy ||P_noise[Psi]||^2
   - Determine appropriate purging rate based on noise level
   - Ensure rate is small enough to prevent signal degradation

4. **Incremental Purging Application**:
   - Apply purging operation: Psi_purged = Psi - epsilon * P_noise[Psi]
   - Update memory state with purged version

5. **Verification Process**:
   - Measure purging effectiveness using:
     E_purge = 1 - ||P_noise[Psi_purged]||^2 / ||P_noise[Psi]||^2
   - Target: E_purge >= 0.95

### 3.5 Code Implementation

```
function implement_incremental_memory_purging():
    # Get current memory state
    Psi = get_current_memory_state()
    
    # Calculate correlation matrix
    C = calculate_correlation_matrix(Psi)
    
    # Perform eigendecomposition
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = eigendecomposition(C)
    
    # Determine signal subspace dimension using threshold
    K = determine_signal_dimension(eigenvalues)
    
    # Extract signal basis vectors
    phi = eigenvectors[:, :K]
    
    # Calculate noise projection
    P_noise = calculate_noise_projection(Psi, phi)
    
    # Calculate noise energy
    noise_energy = calculate_squared_norm(P_noise)
    
    # Determine adaptive purging rate
    epsilon_0 = get_maximum_purging_rate()
    beta = get_noise_sensitivity()
    epsilon = epsilon_0 * (1 - exp(-beta * noise_energy))
    
    # Apply incremental purging
    Psi_purged = Psi - epsilon * P_noise
    
    # Update memory state
    update_memory_state(Psi_purged)
    
    # Verify purging effectiveness
    P_noise_purged = calculate_noise_projection(Psi_purged, phi)
    noise_energy_purged = calculate_squared_norm(P_noise_purged)
    E_purge = 1 - noise_energy_purged / noise_energy
    
    if E_purge >= 0.95:
        log_success("Memory purging successful")
    else:
        log_warning("Memory purging below target effectiveness")
```
